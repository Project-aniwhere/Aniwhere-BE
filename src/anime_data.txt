제목 (Romaji): Uzumaki

제목 (원문): うずまき
줄거리: Four episode anime adaptation of the Junji Ito manga. 

Kurozu-cho, a small fogbound town on the coast of Japan, is cursed. According to Shuichi Saito, the withdrawn boyfriend of teenager Kirie Goshima, their town is haunted not by a person or being but by a pattern: uzumaki, the spiral, the hypnotic secret shape of the world. It manifests itself in small ways: seashells, ferns, whirlpools in water, whirlwinds in air. And in large ways: the spiral marks on people's bodies, the insane obsessions of Shuichi's father, the voice from the cochlea in your inner ear. As the madness spreads, the inhabitants of Kurouzu-cho are pulled ever deeper, as if into a whirlpool from which there is no return...

  이름: Anos Voldigoad
  특징: __Species:__ Mixed Blood (currently), Demon (formerly)

Anos is the reincarnation of the man who was feared as the Demon King of Tyranny 2,000 years ago. He is resolute, stalwart, and invincible. His absolute power instils a veritable self-confidence that is only surpassed by his ego. Because of his overwhelming prowess, Anos possesses an easy going attitude and an unrivalled sense of perseverance when facing any challenge that may come his way.

Despite his title as the Demon King, Anos has a definitive moral compass and generally has a kind and caring outlook. He takes a great interest in the well-being of not only his family, but also his subordinates and followers, and is quick to reward them for their loyalty. He is willing to go through great lengths to assist in their development, in order for them to reach their full potential. Other people may see him as cruel, but his personal creed is not to kill people needlessly. Even if he would never admit it, Anos is very protective of his fellow subordinates and followers.

While Anos is not inherently evil, his chaotic and sometimes ruthless methods when dealing with his enemies, earned him his title. While he originally never proclaimed himself as the Demon King, he has openly embraced it as the rest of the world views him as such. Those who oppose him, fear his power, and are threatened by the mere fact that a single man possesses such power.

A cautious and stingy person, Momonga always tries to plan and control details, avoiding any haphazard actions. Because he doesn't underestimate his opponents, he will usually overkill them. Since being transferred to a new world and becoming an actual Undead being, Momonga could feel himself becoming very cold and calculating, his emotions repressed.

Loyal to his friends and creations, since becoming Lord ruler of Nazarick in the new world he acts with a certain degree of nobility for his devoted followers. Momonga only does things that will benefit Nazarick or himself, whether its information or prestige.

While she tries to act calm, as befitting of her role, any perceived insult against Ainz or Nazarick, real or imagined, sends her into a rage. Like most inhabitants of Nazarick, she despises humans which she refers to as "lower life-forms." ~!Though the reason is not yet known, Albedo holds a strong hatred towards all of the 41 Supreme Beings except for Ainz. It is hinted that she is scheming to annihilate all the other guild members if they are found.!~

-등장인물-
  이름: Buhuan Shang
  특징: Hailing from Xi You, Shang Bu Huan is a warrior who has taken the responsibility of stealing the mystical swords created during the Ancient demon wars, to keep them out of the wrong hands. He is very aware of the way others feel, but despite his great skill and charisma, Lang Wu Yao claims his compassion is his own worst enemy. He is an enigmatic wandering swordsman, alone by the time of season one.

Shang Bu Huan outwardly appears cold and uncaring, acting as if he doesn't care what others are doing and that everyone around him is crazy or unreasonable. But this apathetic persona doesn't come from a need to live up to a wandering swordsman, instead coming from his desire to stay out of peoples lives and not troubling himself with their problems. However, due to his compassionate nature, he always ends up helping the people he comes across. He often gives people advice after saving them, like Lang Wu Yao, Juan Can Yun, and his own imposter. Preferring to stay quiet (other than complaining), he still feels a need to speak his mind when others tell him of their reasons for living. His own philosophy was essentially challenged when Lang Wu Yao attempts to kill Lou Zhen Jie.

Shang's motivation for taking the sorcerous swords threatening his home is not only to keep them from the magistrate, but to keep them from the people who want revenge on the magistrate. Not believing in things like revenge, he is only concerned with keeping dangerous people away from coming into contact with these otherworldly demon blades.

Bu Huan carries a wooden sword, which as he claims, has the benefits of not rusting, being lighter, and easier to maintain.

-등장인물-
  이름: Lucy Heartfilia
  특징: A mage from the Fairy Tail guild who wields Celestial Spirit magic.

Lucy is cheerful, clever, and often gets swept along by her disruptive guildmates when they go overboard. Empathetic, caring, and more likely to write novels than wage battles, Lucy becomes most emboldened to challenge enemies when she needs to fight for her friends. She is said to be a noisy and somewhat fussy person, and there are times when she can be naive and too easily forgiving, greedy for validation as well as overly confident at inopportune moments. However, despite any failings and instances of self-doubt, she doesn't allow herself to feel down for too long - her optimism is boundless.

In July of Earth Land year X784, Lucy is a normal 17-year-old Fioran who wishes to join the infamous mage guild, Fairy Tail - although they have a reputation for being thoroughly destructive, she admires their strength and numbers. After a fateful meeting with two members of the guild in the town of Hargeon, Natsu Dragneel and his flying blue cat, Happy, she travels with them back to Fairy Tail, located in Magnolia, to begin the adventure of a lifetime.

~!Lucy's surname is quickly revealed to be quite significant, for it distinguishes her as a member of the Heartfilia family, who head a powerful and wealthy organization called the Heartfilia Konzern. The Heartfilia's connection to Celestial Sprit Magic becomes a key point later on.!~
  성우: Aya Hirano

  이름: Wendy Marvell
  특징: Wendy is the sky dragon slayer. She has the ability to heal and manipulate air.
  성우: Satomi Satou

  이름: Natsu Dragneel
  특징: A mage from the Fairy Tail Guild who wields fire dragon slayer magic.

Natsu has a carefree and reckless nature and, despite his constant brawls with the other members of the guild, is a fiercely loyal and protective friend. He has a particularly close and competitive relationship with Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet. With the former, he has had a constant rivalry from a young age and although they often denounce each other as not being friends, they regularly watch each others' back even when they are enraged with one another. He has had the same sort of relationship with Erza - the two both being scared of her since a young age - and they seemed to have a fairly good relationship in the past as, according to Erza, they used to shower together. He befriends people rather quickly too, considering Lucy a friend and willing to team up with her only after a few days of knowing her.

Igneel, a dragon, found him in the forest and ended up taking care of him. He taught Natsu how to speak, read, and use magic. But one day Igneel disappeared without a trace. Because of this, Natsu's goal in life is to find him. 

~!Natsu is also among the five Dragon Slayers sent to the future from four hundred years past, having an additional purpose in the assistance of the defeat of Acnologia.!~

~!He is the younger brother of Zeref Dragneel, having originally died 400 years ago, being subsequently revived as his brother's most powerful Etherious: E.N.D.!~
  성우: Tetsuya Kakihara

  이름: Gray Fullbuster
  특징: __Occupation:__ Mage 
__Affiliation:__ Fairy Tail Guild 
__Team:__ Team Natsu 
__Magic:__ Ice-Make, Ice Magic, ~!Ice Devil Slayer Magic!~

Gray Fullbuster is a member of the Fairy Tail guild. He is an 18 year-old ice mage, practicing ice alchemy, the art of molding ice. Due to his training history, he is most comfortable in little clothing and often forgets to wear clothes or quickly takes it off, thus often being accused of being an exhibitionist. He and Natsu have a friendly rivalry, and can often be seen fighting one another. Lucy believes the nature of his magic is the reason that he and Natsu constantly bicker. His member stamp is on the right side of his chest.   

~!Gray's adeptness and strength as an ice mage is quickly shown in the story. During the Lullaby of Death arc, he teams with Natsu and Erza to defeat the demon awakened from the evil spirit from the Lullaby of Death. Members of the League praise his quickness at molding ice. Later in the story, he defeats Juvia, one of the Elemental Four of Phantom Lord. This victory may have been partly influenced by Juvia's liking to Gray. Juvia comments on Gray's skill, shocked that he was able to freeze both her boiling water and the rain. After Phantom Lord's defeat, Juvia secretly spies on Gray, bringing a packed lunch for Gray while he and the guild are rebuilding the headquarters.!~  

In certain panels, Gray's necklaces looks quite similar to the Rave Stone which is a crucial part of another one of Mashima's stories, "Rave Master." Mashima has stated he doesn't remember the name. He takes off his clothes because Ul made him do it as one of her teachings and now it's a force of habit.

  성우: Yuuichi Nakamura

  이름: Erza Scarlet
  특징: An S-class mage from the Fairy Tail Guild who uses requip magic, which allows her to summon weapons and equip armor stored in another dimension. She is the strongest active female member.

Erza is a very strict, intimidating, and impatient person with a strong sense of justice. She has been a member of Fairy Tail since she was a kid, and shows great loyalty and dedication to Makarov and the guild.

~!Erza used to be a nameless child slave where she was forced to help build a tower called the R-system. Over time Erza made friends with other slaves, one of them being a boy her age named Jellal, who gave her the name "Scarlet" because of the color of her hair. She was eventually able to break free and escape-- this was also the time when her magic awakened.

After she escaped, she sought to find Fairy Tail, which she had heard about from a fellow slave named Rob who cared for her like a grandpa.!~

~!She has an artificial eye, given to her by Porlyusica, used to replace her right eye which had become blind due to an injury.!~

-등장인물-
  이름: Aliceliese Lou Nebulis IX
  특징: Aliceliese is a calm person and a kind heart to which she uses mostly to protect her family legacy. While she comes off as a cold fighter when she's on the battlefield, Aliceliese isn't much different from a normal girl her age. She enjoys going to the opera (having cried during one play), and is a fan of art and can be very talkative at times.

Being a teenage girl, Alice has some interest in the opposite sex. Not having many males her age around her, she expresses most of this interest in Iska when they're not on the battlefield. She even treats their rivalry as something similar to a relationship, as Rin compared the way she was planning for their final battle to planning for a wedding.
  성우: Sora Amamiya

  이름: Iska
  특징: Iska is the main protagonist of the series. He is the current wielder of the Astral Swords and is determined to end what he considers a pointless war. 

He was the youngest Saint Disciple to ever receive the title; but after releasing a "witch" from captivity, he was stripped of his rank and imprisoned for life. Circumstances around the war against the Nebulis Sovereignty have led to his release, but his goals haven't changed. 

Iska has a moral code that doesn’t discriminate, even if a supposed enemy is at hand. He shows kindness and bravery, despite putting himself at risk, and even willing to risk committing treason for them. On the battlefield, Iska becomes very fierce yet also calm, not being afraid of whatever power his opponent has or taking dangerous gambles to protect himself from their attacks. However, Iska usually avoids cutting down most opponents when he doesn't see any value in doing so, simply knocking them out. This has led Iska to be known as a 'peace-loving war nut'.

  이름: Nene Alkastone
  특징: Nene is a supporting character of the anime KimiSen. Along with Jhin, Iska and Mismis, they make up the members of the 907th unit with her specialty being able to graph coordinates of her target to a machine and releasing out projectiles to her enemies. She is a cheerful and high spirited girl that will help her teammates even if they go into such troubles, such as when Mismis became an Astral Mage after being exposed to a spirit vortex. She usually sees Iska as her brother and has a close relationship with her squad. Her weapons includes an anti-astral power grenade that disrupts the use of astral powers in a defined range, and has a ring that can indicate the position of her target.
  성우: Kaori Ishihara

  이름: Rin Vispose
  특징: 
  성우: Yumiri Hanamori

  이름: Mismis Klass
  특징: Mismis is a supporting character in KimiSen. She is the captain of the 907th unit belonging to Iska's squad. She can be seen as a cute yet highly supportive teammate since her fighting skills are subpar to the other characters in her squad. Even though that she isn't highly smart with combat, she is usually the morale booster of their team, and gives everyone the emotional support that they need. She was formerly a human until she was sucked into the vortex where she got exposed. Her power included nullifying every astral mage's to use their abilities whenever she uses hers.

Being  the oldest person in their group, she acts and looks childish as she contains many stuff animals and cute dresses in her room. She also considers herself to be a girl rather than a woman and doesn't like it people call her a child.

He is initially hot-headed and prone to bursts of anger, and at first blames Captain Okita for the death of his brother in battle. However, he matures during the first season thanks to his responsibility as the Yamato 's battle chief, and ultimately Okita nominates him acting captain when he is unable to continue.

He is also a talented pilot, flying his own Cosmo Zero fighter as the leader of the Black Tigers, and in the second season frequently joining the Cosmo Tigers in battle.

-등장인물-
  이름: Holo
  특징: __Height:__ 160 cm

Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known as Yoitsu. She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.  

She refers to herself as the "Wise Wolf of Yoitsu" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it.  

Concerning the spelling of Holo's name, Yen Press has stated that they "were instructed that the proper spelling of the character's name is indeed Holo" by the Japanese licensor.

  이름: Arisu Sakayanagi
  특징: __Height:__ 150 cm (4'11")

Arisu Sakayanagi is one of the class representatives of class 1-A along with Kōhei Katsuragi. She suffers from congenital heart disease which limits her physical ability. 

She appears as a petite teenage girl with lilac-coloured hair and violet eyes. She wears a black beret on her head with a grey ribbon connected to it and wears the standard school uniform. She often walks with a cane due to her health condition. 

She appears to possess a "go with the flow" attitude as she accepts most situations with no protest though she voices her dislike of boring situations after Katsuragi noted of the class scores. Unlike Kōhei Katsuragi, who has a conservative stance, Arisu possesses an innovative attitude. Together, the pair effectively lead class A through the school years.

She enjoys situations she finds interesting as shown when she smiled at Kakeru Ryūen's declaration to rule the school or when she listened to the speech of Suzune Horikita and found it amusing. In the light novels, Arisu enjoys toying with people as seen when she cryptically hinted to Kiyotaka Ayanokōji of knowing him while he had voiced he never saw her before. Later on, while being together with Honami Ichinose, she also had the chance to show her confidence and complacency after Teruhiko Yukimura of Ayanokōji Group boldly claimed that D-Class has the plan to overtake A-Class soon.

Additionally, although she has an easygoing personality, it was shown in the later part of the series that she's easily provoked when being described based on her petite appearance (e.g. "Little Girl") as she believes that it doesn't give her justice due to her domineering quality.
  성우: Rina Hidaka

  이름: Suzune Horikita
  특징: __Height:__ 156 cm (5'1½")

A beautiful girl who sits next to Ayanokouji. She is the opposite of Ayanokouji when it comes to friendship; she disregards it and thinks of making friends unnecessary, thus she does not communicate much with her classmates. She is not convinced that she was placed in the D class, therefore she aims to get promoted to the A class.
  성우: Akari Kitou

  이름: Kei Karuizawa
  특징: __Height:__ 154 cm

She is a girl with a bad attitude who is located at the top of the D class hierarchy. She fights with Kushida for their class' top 2 places. Even though she gives off the impression of someone who is careless, arrogant, and messy, Kei's true self is very logical and astute with a sharp mind. She has remarkable ability to read the environment and the people around her, and makes the correct decision often.

~!During her time in middle school, Kei was known to always be the headstrong and competitive type, unwittingly causing her to make enemies out of similar girls and becoming the target of severe and cruel bullying by their hands. Due to her trauma, Kei developed a very twisted mindset based purely on the urge to protect herself from any kind of abuse or intimidation, no matter what kind of method she needed to use or the sacrifices she needed to make, which is the reason for her bad attitude. !~

~! In year 1, volume 4, her relationship with Hirata Yousuke is revealed to be fake, which they fostered to protect her from bullying. After being promised protection by Kiyotaka, in return for being his pawn. She eventually breaks up with Hirata, since the original reason for their relationship no longer existed, and since she had started developing romantic feelings for Kiyotaka. !~

~! In the epilogue of volume 11.5, Kiyotaka declares his love for her and she accepts. !~

~! In Year 2, Volume 5, Kei and Kiyotaka reveal their relationship to the rest of the class. !~
  성우: Ayana Taketatsu

  이름: Kakeru Ryuuen
  특징: __Height:__ 173 cm (5'8")

Kakeru Ryuuen is the class representative of class 1-C and is known for being an infamous delinquent. He does not lead his class by trust, but rather by fear. He has a group of henchmen who do his dirty work, which contributes to his fearsome reputation.

-등장인물-
  이름: Hana Asakura
  특징: He is the six year old son of Yoh Asakura and Anna Kyoyama who is now traveling with Ryu, but is currently in the custody of Tamao Tamamura.  He only appears in the special chapter, Funbari no Uta. He works with Ryu to search for someone. Hana is once shown holding the Futsunomitama (also known as the Antiquity in the English anime), which may mean he can use a Giant Over Soul like Yoh's. Tamao is introduced as his 'mother', but it is revealed that she is only acting as his guardian until Yoh and Anna return. At first Hana is apparently unaware that Tamao is not actually his mother; Tamao has chosen not to tell him who his true parents are until they return and she debuts as an enka singer. However in the final chapter of the KanZenBan manga, Hana is aware of who his parents are and welcomes them back by kicking Yoh in the stomach.  The name "Hana" means flower. Hana's name comes from the conjunction of the characters in Yoh (葉, also pronounced as Ha) and Anna's (ナ, Na) names.  One piece of evidence that points to Hana being their son is that, in volume 9 of the manga, Yoh and Anna slept together the night before leaving for America for the second round of the Shaman Fight. Also, Yohken asks him whether he has any children, where Yoh replies "No...well, how can I say that?", but is informed otherwise by Amidamaru.  He is the main character in the new series Shaman King: Flowers, where he is a teen who uses his father Yoh's spirit Amidamaru. He meets the current Shaman King Hao who tells him something interesting will happen for him and disappears. Almost immediately a young girl resembling Anna appears saying she is her disciple and daughter of Silva and will marry Hana if he can beat her in a fight.  Hana Asakura was probably conceived shortly before or shortly after the Shaman Fight. His true birthdate is unknown. All we know for sure is that he is the son of Yoh and Anna.  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  성우: Youko Hikasa

  이름: Amidamaru
  특징: Samurai that died during the Muromachi period 600 years ago - now is Yoh's ghost companion. He is very powerful and wise but quite taciturn and extremely devoted to &quot;Lord Yoh&quot; (&quot;Yō-dono&quot; in Japanese). He was greatly known around the town of Funbari, where he had died 600 years prior after killing several hundred other samurai soldiers during a battle. He is the original handler of the legendary sword named &quot;Harusame&quot;, meaning &quot;Spring Rain&quot;, a sword forged by his best friend, Mosuke, who also appeared in the anime/manga as a spirit. This very same sword was reproduced as a &quot;spirit sword&quot; and used by Asakura Yoh during the Shaman Fight. The original was kept in a museum. His name is based on the Buddha Amitabha, the principal figure in the Pure Land Buddhist sect.

It soon becomes clear that behind the luxurious lifestyle and ritualized routines of the Ooku lie sinister schemes and cynical rivalries. Meanwhile, a mysterious wandering potion-peddler known only as the Medicine Seller subtly insinuates himself into the Ooku, just as an uncanny, otherworldly menace begins to reveal itself.

-등장인물-
  이름: Kusuriuri
  특징: A mysterious wandering man with a vast knowledge of the supernatural and is mystical in appearance. He carries around a large wooden box filled with medicine and holy tools. Among them is an enchanted sword that is used to slay the mononoke. To use the sword, the Medicine Seller must find the "Katachi" (shape), "Makoto" (truth), and "Kotowari" (reasoning) of the mononoke he wishes to exorcise. Once the sword has been unsheathed, he transforms into a demon-like creature.

While his origins are unknown, it is clear that the Medicine Seller is not human or at least not entirely human; he has elf-like ears, and pointy canine teeth. Even in the time-skip Bakeneko arc, the Medicine Seller still appears as the same handsome youth from the previous arcs (the only differences in his appearance from previous arcs is he now wears small round red stud earrings and a ring on his index finger).~!It was revealed in the Umibozu episode when the ayakashi asked the passenger's fears, the Medicine Seller calmly answers he is afraid that there is no form, truth, or reason at the edge of the world, thus no longer having a reason to exist.!~(Source: Wikipedia)

줄거리: The fifth season of Date A Live.

Shidou Itsuka faces greater peril than ever due to his continued involvement with Ratatoskr. He has already sealed 10 Spirits, and Isaac Westcott, leader of Deus Ex Machina Industries, has finally decided to kill Shidou and plunder the Spirits' powers for himself.

To achieve his goal, Isaac declares an all-out war against Ratatoskr, forcing the organization to exhaust its resources to ensure Shidou's survival. Despite being severely outnumbered and outmatched, a glimmer of hope exists in the form of the Spirit of Time, Kurumi Tokisaki. Shidou must seal and acquire Kurumi's power to travel to the past and confront the Spirit of Origin—the catalyst that started it all.

-등장인물-
  이름: Shidou Itsuka
  특징: __Height:__ 170 cm

Shidou Itsuka is a student of Raizen High School. He was adopted into the Itsuka family when he was "abandoned" by his mother.   ~!Shidou has the ability to seal a spirit's power. However, the reason why he possesses it is shrouded in mystery. Due to this power which was already known by Kotori Itsuka he was recruited--or rather forced--to join "Ratatoskr" to help and save Spirits. Instead of killing Spirits to prevent spacequake from happening, he has to seal the Spirit's powers with a kiss in order for them to co-exist with humans.  Shidou met his real sister at volume 3 which was [Mana Takamiya](https://anilist.co/character/72283). Shidou, Mana and [Kotori](https://anilist.co/character/65263) can't remember much about what happened 5 years ago because a certain "Spirit/person" locked their memories away, and at that time Shidou met [Origami](https://anilist.co/character/65261) and helped her which was the cause as of why Origami fell for Shidou.  Once the power of a Spirit is sealed within Shidou, he has the ability to use some portion of it, thus his resurrection power is from Kotori's abilities when he sealed Kotori's Spirit 5 years ago.!~
  성우: Nobunaga Shimazaki

  이름: Tooka Yatogami
  특징: __Code name:__ Princess
__Height:__ 155 cm

Tooka Yatogami's name is given by Shidou the second time they met. Due to being a spirit, she is always being targeted by the AST and is aiming for the kill; because of this, she hated humans for always shunning her and thinking that she wasn't allowed to live in this world. However, her whole life changed when she met Shidou.  Even with that high and cool presence, Tooka lacks some common sense and loves food very much.   ~!Once her power was sealed, she wasn't being targeted by the AST anymore, and she started attending Shidou's high school. Her surname was given by Reine.  She was overjoyed that she could live with Shidou now, but knowing that Origami was there too, she was somehow agitated and is always having a minor quarrel with Origami (mostly because of Shidou and their feelings).!~
  성우: Marina Inoue

  이름: Reine Murasame
  특징: __Height:__ 164 cm

She is highly intelligent and the Analysis Officer of Ratatosk's Fraxinus Crew.  She can be more called as the Vice Commander of the crew rather than [Kannazuki Kyouhei](https://anilist.co/character/75394), it is usually her at the side of [Kotori](https://anilist.co/character/65263) managing things around the crew. She transferred to Raizen Highschool as a physics teacher and an assistant home-room teacher at [Shidou](https://anilist.co/character/65257)'s class. She has this very big eyebags which you can tell she hasn't been sleeping for years.

~!At some point of time she can be reliable and take command of the directions which Shidou needs to do when dating a spirit. She acts like the "mother" of Shidou and the other Spirits to help them on their troubles and such.!~
  성우: Aya Endou

  이름: Mio
  특징: ~!The First Spirit was the first Spirit to ever make an appearance on Earth. 30 years before the beginning of the events in Date A Live, she was summoned into the world by Sir Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott, Ellen Mira Mathers, and Elliot Baldwin Woodman through unknown means. However, her summoning also caused the first spacequake in history at some point of the frontier between China and Mongolia, killing over 150 million people and starting a chain of similar disasters around the world that would last approximately six months.!~
  성우: Aya Endou

  이름: Kurumi Tokisaki
  특징: **Height:** 157 cm

Kurumi is the third spirit who appeared after Tohka and Yoshino. She has a split personality: that of a gentle, mysterious highschool girl with a slow talking pattern, and that of a psychopathic killer. She is very aggressive in her actions which makes it harder for Shidou to capture her.   ~!Kurumi has the archangel Zafkiel, and has the power to control over time. The reason why she keeps appearing after being killed by Mana countless times was because of her powers. For example, she can heal herself by turning back the time. She uses a gunblade as her weapon.  Though she always keeps getting killed by Mana, Kurumi from a different time period appeared and was considered as the most deadly of all took down Mana, Tohka, and Origami at near end of volume 3. It is said that her ultimate goal is to get the powers of the spirit inside Shidou to kill the very first spirit who appeared 30 years ago to make all spirits disappear from this world. Her angel is destroyed by Kotori in volume 4.!~   ~!The twelve Roman numerals on the clock in her left eye have different powers that only the original Kurumi can use, but by using their powers, it will cause her life to be eaten away. In order to avoid this, she kills people to obtain 'time'.!~

-등장인물-
  이름: Rachel
  특징: __Species:__ Human
__Rank:__ Extra

Rachel, also known as Michelle Light was Baam's best and only friend as she was the only one to visit him in his "cave". She longs to see the stars which is one of the fabled rewards waiting at the top of the Tower, because she "fears the Night".
~!Like Baam she is an Irregular.!~
  성우: Saori Hayami

  이름: Twenty-Fifth Baam
  특징: __Species:__ Human
__Height:__ 168cm (Part 1), 180cm (Part II)
__Rank:__ Irregular
__Position:__ Wave Controller
__Born:__  ~!Floor of Death!~
__Occupation:__  ~!FUG Slayer Candidate!~

Twenty-Fifth Baam is an Irregular and one of the main protagonists of Tower of God. Bam entered in search of his best friend Rachel, and after passing Headon's test he was deemed worthy to climb the Tower.

In Part I, he is a highly empathetic and caring young man, understanding little of life, having had virtually no contact with people before meeting Rachel and later entering the Tower. He hates loneliness and other people's loneliness. He is considered very naive and knows little about the Tower. During Part I, his only reason for climbing the Tower is to be with Rachel.

In Part II:
~!
He was forced to join FUG, and received then the name of Jue Viole Grace (쥬 비올레 그레이스), the Slayer Candidate, to keep his real identity hidden. As Viole, he is far more violent. He now has friends to protect and will not hesitate to fight if it means protecting them. He now completely understands that in order to climb the Tower, he must be pre-emptive and prepared to engage in combat and eradicate all opposition. He's become more introverted, rarely ever speaking or displaying any signs of emotion. He's also quite cold and calculating, interacting with others only out of necessity and will take advantage of a situation to defeat his opponents.

Later in the Part as FUG's hold on him weakens, he begins to be more expressive and talkative. Later, when he officially meets with Khun and Rak for the first time in seven years, he smiles happily and embraces them, showing that his original personality that he had hidden away to protect himself from FUG's influence was resurfacing.
!~


In Part III:
~!
He is completely back to his normal self, with the addition of some improvements in areas such as confidence. He additionally dropped the 'Viole' look and sticks with an updated 'Baam' look. He is still often called both Baam and Viole now. He now goes through new questions such as what to do when he can't save everyone, and old questions, such as why everyone can't just get along, but he is more accepting of things than before, all the while continually fighting stronger enemies and becoming stronger.
!~
  성우: Taichi Ichikawa

  이름: Rak Wraithraiser
  특징: __Species:__ Wraithraiser, ~!Native One!~
__Height:__ 3m (Decompressed)
__Rank:__ Regular C-Rank
__Position:__ Spear Bearer

Rak Wraithraiser is a Regular. He unwillingly teamed up with [Baam](https://anilist.co/character/84769/TwentyFifth-Baam) and [Khun](https://anilist.co/character/84781/Khun-Aguero-Agnis) during the first test on the Second Floor and passed other tests with them. He was selected for the Spear Bearer position. He is a large and powerful warrior and a very confident individual.
<div rel="spoiler">Rak is originally a 3 meter tall creature, but after he mocked the Ranker [Yu Han Sung](https://anilist.co/character/141286/Sung-Yu-Han), the Second Floor Test Director, his body was shrunken by them. He eventually found out how to get back to his original size. As a being who can control their body size, he is a Compression Licenser.</div><div rel="spoiler">He is a direct descendant of the Native One, a type of being that is able to rule over the elements in the Tower. </div>

Rak doesn't come off as particularly smart; he thinks he's superior to almost everyone else and so refers to other people as "turtles". He occasionally calls himself "Rakleader" when he is feeling particularly full of himself, although Khun may be to blame for indulging him. He tries to make himself appear tough, although he's actually a bit of a baby sometimes. However, he does seem to have a little of a caring side in him.
  성우: 

  이름: Aguero Agnis Khun
  특징: __Species:__ Human
__Height:__ 170 cm
__Rank:__ Regular
__Position:__ Light Bearer

Khun relies heavily on his master intellect, however, this is not his only strong field. He also has exceptional physical attributes and is a skilled Light Bearer. His powers in combat cannot be denied.
  성우: Nobuhiko Okamoto

  이름: Yuri Ha Jahad
  특징: Ha Yuri Jahad, more commonly known as Yu​ri Jahad (lacking her family name), is a High Ranker and Princess from the Ha Family. Notably, she is one of the most famous Princesses and therefore highly favored, with much political influence throughout The Tower.

줄거리: When young adventurer Laios and his company are attacked and soundly thrashed by a dragon deep in a dungeon, the party loses all its money and provisions...and a member! They're eager to go back and save her, but there is just one problem: If they set out with no food or coin to speak of, they're sure to starve on the way! But Laios comes up with a brilliant idea: "Let's eat the monsters!" Slimes, basilisks, and even dragons...none are safe from the appetites of these dungeon-crawling gourmands!

-등장인물-
  이름: Laios Thorden
  특징: __Height:__ 185 cm (6'1")

Laios is the leader of his party and Falin's older brother. He is a tall-man from the Northern Continent.

Laios is a monster fanatic and a strong fighter. His deep knowledge and passion for monsters helps him to excel in combat and dungeon exploration. However, social skills are where he often falters; he struggles to pick up social cues, resulting in a lack of awareness and tact. This has caused him a lot of trouble throughout his life, a shortcoming that he is painfully aware of and insecure about. Despite this, Laios is extremely kindhearted, accepting, and friendly.
  성우: Kentarou Kumagai, Natsu Yorita

  이름: Marcille Donato
  특징: __Height:__ 160 cm (5'3")

Marcille is mage who is part of Laios' party. She is an elf from the Northern Continent.

~!She is actually half-elf and half tall-man. Her mother is an elf, and father was a tall-man who passed away when Marcille was young.!~

Marcille is kind, intelligent, principled, and loyal to her friends. However, she can also be very high-strung and has a difficult time dealing with things far outside her comfort zone (such as eating monsters). She has a lot of confidence in her magic ability due to her background, and can feel lonely when she's unable to help the party. She was one of the best students at the Magic Academy, where she joined the research program specializing in dungeon-making; this is where she met Falin, and is still her closest friend to this day. Marcille can also be a bit naive at times, believing that friendships alone can keep a party together.
  성우: Sayaka Senbongi

  이름: Senshi
  특징: __Height:__ 140 cm (4'7")

Senshi is a member of Laios' party. He is a dwarf from the Eastern Continent.

Having spent 10 years studying monster cuisine and living a self-sufficient life inside the dungeon, Senshi loves cooking and is more than happy to share his knowledge and skills. He is dependable and strong, but can also be rather stubborn and set in his ways. He helps maintain the natural environment and ecology of the dungeon, and considers  himself part of it. He dislikes magic and treats it with a great deal of gravity and caution.
  성우: Hiroshi Naka, Kenta Ookuma

  이름: Chilchuck Tims
  특징: __Height:__ 110 cm (3'7")

Chilchuck is a member of Laios' party. He is a half-foot from the Eastern Continent.

Chilchuck is shrewd, practical, and sharp-tongued. He refuses to take jobs unless he is paid in advance. His specialties are lockpicking and identifying and disarming traps. He's more open to eating monsters than Marcille is, but like her, draws a hard line at humanoids. He generally goes along with whatever the party does, but will speak frankly when they do something that can get them killed. His job as the party rogue puts him on edge, as failure to undo or avoid traps can lead his companions to immediate mortal danger. When his party members ignore his warnings, he quickly becomes agitated. He prefers to keep his private life separate from his work, so he doesn't tell his party a lot about himself.

~!He has a wife and 3 daughters, but hasn't seen them in years.!~
  성우: Asuna Tomari

  이름: Falin Thorden
  특징: __Height:__ 170 cm (5'7")

Falin is Laios's younger sister and a mage specializing in support spells. She is a tall-man from the Northern Continent.

Falin is a very kind, caring, and considerate person who doesn't want to hurt others. She extends this kindness even to the restless dead, who she has been attuned to since childhood. She can also be self-sacrificing and reckless; if the lives of her loved ones are in danger, she would not hesitate to take the blow in their stead. Like her brother, Falin has also had a fanatic interest in biology from a young age.

Upon returning to Japan, he became a member of the MSBY Black Jackals, a Division 1 team in the V-League. He became a member of the Japan Men’s National Volleyball Team during the 2021 Olympics.

__Number:__ 9 
__Position:__ Setter 

A famous setter in his middle school who joins the Karusuno High Volleyball team.

In contrast to his appearance, he is rather quiet and gentle and has his difficulties realizing that he is Karasuno's ace as he initially doesn't feel that way. He shows to be weak-willed at the beginning when he leaves the team before the first years come, feeling that he let down his entire team when they lost against Date Tech High even though they counted on him. After coming back to Karasuno, he realizes that his will to play volleyball is much stronger than he thought and with the help of his teammates, he acknowledges his position as Karasuno's ace (even though he is still mocked sometimes by Daichi for not having any "ace-like presence") and gains self-confidence.

-등장인물-
  이름: Kaori Shirasaki
  특징: Kaori is one the most caring personalities in the series. She is a classmate of Hajime's back in their original world. She admires Hajime for his "strong" personalty and is the only classmate who pays attention to Hajime's existence in class even if she is popular in their school.

When summoned to another world, she receives the "Healer" job.

~!
Kaori was unable to notice her love for Hajime until he fell in the abyss which inspired her to become stronger in order to search for him. After reuniting with Hajime, she then joins their dungeon expeditions after confessing to him.!~

~! In volume 6, while Hajime is off fighting the first of the God's Apostles alone. Kaori becomes gravely injured back at the capital while fighting off one of her classmates. After Hajime wins the fight he learns of Kaori's weakened state and decides to transfer the soul of Kaori into the body of the apostle. In doing so Kaori becomes stronger all across the board and over time she learns to use the same abilities the apostle used against Hajime. !~
  성우: Saori Oonishi

  이름: Hajime Nagumo
  특징: __Height:__ 175 cm

Hajime was a complete otaku and always came to class with a sleepy expression. He was always bullied and was disliked by both of his male and female classmates for being close to their idol-like classmate Kaori. After wishing for his annoying classmates to be summoned to another world, the next thing he saw was they were on top of a pillar like structure in another world to become heroes.

He obtained the job of "Synergist" and continued to be bullied due to also being weak in this new world. He eventually fell into an abyss due to being hit by a classmate's fireball where he survived though a hell-like environment to become the powerful man he is today.

Hajime at the beginning of the story is said to have black hair and also has a slim body. He also had a kind face and attitude. But after falling in the abyss and eating a wolf-like monster, his body began to violently degenerate. When he drunk the sacred water, it made his body heal by destroying his bones and muscles then healing over and over again until he got a very muscular body due to overcompensation.

Due to the stress of breaking and healing, his hair turned white, a victim of the Marie Antoinette syndrome. His eyes also turned red and his body gained tattoo-like red lines which is the sign of him becoming a demonic monster similar to the monsters he ate that also possessed red lines along their bodies.

His personality was at first kind though he was considered incompetent. But after falling in the abyss, he became cruel and would kill any person who wants to cause him misfortune. He would also smile in front of danger which made Shia call him a new species of monster called "Predator." He may be cruel but he cares for his comrades.
  성우: Toshinari Fukamachi

Her appearance was described to be like the highest grade bisque doll with blonde hair and crimson eyes. She is 323 years old despite her small physique because she is a Vampire Princess. Her name Yue isn't her real name and was only given by Hajime so that she could leave her dark past and move on.

  성우: Yuuki Kuwahara

  이름: Shia Haulia
  특징: Shia first appeared when Hajime and Yue were traveling in the Raisen Grand Canyon while being chased by a monster like a "shameless rabbit."

She soon became their traveling companion in the long run, having the attitude to get clingy to Hajime with energetic words and actions.

~!She came from a demi-human race tribe called Haulia, RabbitMan. She was described as having a body with beautiful curves, "melon" sized chest, grey hair having traces of blue pigments, blue eyes and of course bunny ears. She was discriminated by her own race because she was born different as a demi-human being able to use magic which resulted to Haulia tribe's banishment.

Shia wields a war hammer "Doryukken" made, named and enhanced by Hajime. Her age is 16 and has a job class of Diviner and also known for her Physical strengthening and "Foresight" ability.!~
  성우: Minami Takahashi

  이름: Tio Klarus
  특징: Tio is a "pervert" with the main status of M but she is honest and the words this one speakeas are similar to the old legends. Her "M" personality was made into this because she was defeated by Hajime's party in the northern mountains of the village of Ul. She's loyal and devoted herself to Hajime to become his slave and calls him since then "Master."

~!
Tio originally came from the Ryujin tribe Clarce, half-dragon. Her magic and defense are significantly high especially in her Dragon form, even Hajime's party attacks only cracked the scales of this dragon. She is aged 563 years old and respected by Yue but not for so long. Her appearance is a woman of her 20's with "watermelon" chests and golden eyes.

줄거리:  New anime project for MECHA-UDE, as a full-fledged anime series. 
Long ago, alien lifeforms came to Earth, fusing with people on the planet. Due to their appearance, they were dubbed "Mecha-ude," as when fused, they bore a striking resemblance to mechanized limbs.

Through an involuntary partnership, average middle schooler Hikaru Amatsuga works alongside the Mecha-ude Arma, who is an extremely rare and special existence. To protect Arma, the resistance group ARMS assigns the dual Mecha-ude user Aki Murasame to follow him wherever he goes. However, she is also looking for a mysterious Snake-Type Mecha-ude wielder, who has put many of her comrades in a critical state.

Behind the scenes, an organization known as the Kagami Group is searching for the mythical "Trigger Arm," a Mecha-ude said to grant unlimited power. When Aki's life is threatened by this group, Hikaru must team up with Arma to find the courage to fight back and, along the way, learn that his life will never be ordinary again.

줄거리: In the near future, a sudden and unexplained sea rise has left much of human civilization underwater. Ikaruga Natsuki, a boy who lost his mother and one of his legs in an accident some years earlier, returns disillusioned from a harsh life in the big city to find his old countryside home half-swallowed by the sea. Left without a family, all he has to his name is the ship and submarine left to him by his oceanologist grandmother, and her debts. His only hope to restore the dreams for the future that he has lost is to take up an opportunity presented to him by the suspicious debt collector Catherine. They set sail to search the sunken ruins of his grandmother's laboratory in order to find a treasure rumor says she left there. But what they find is not riches or jewels; it is a strange girl lying asleep in a coffin at the bottom of the sea, Atri. Atri is a robot, but her appearance and her wealth of emotions would fool anyone into thinking she's a living, breathing human being. In gratitude for being salvaged, she makes a declaration to Natsuki.

  성우: Jun Fukuyama

  이름: Buwei Lü
  특징: A merchant who ranked up as Qin's Right Chancellor.   ~!Shortly after he is introduced, it is revealed that he is planning to keep his army in Wei until Zheng Ying dies, then storm Qin's capital of Xianyang, denouncing Jiao Cheng as a tyrant and taking the throne for himself. !~
  성우: Tesshou Genda

  이름: Xin Li
  특징: The hero of the story. A war orphan who aims to become the "World's Greatest General". He later meets Zheng Ying, the future first king that would rule all of China.
  성우: Masakazu Morita

  이름: Yi Huan
  특징: Yi Huan is a Vice General who serves in Great General Ao Meng's army. In the past, he was a bandit leader with the moniker Yi Huan the Beheader.

His personality is said to be extremely brutal as he has no qualms in killing surrendered soldiers and personally beheaded every person in any city or village he conquered. This is shown in how he sends Wei soldiers, who have been severely tortured, along with bags of eyeballs back to their camp to decrease morale and incite fear.

He always has an arrogant smirk on his face and talks in a crude manner at times. He shows no respect for his foes as he calls Feng Xuan "an old fart" and "trash" before killing him. He is exhibits a sense of humor and sarcasm as in the case when a fellow crew member asked him why he made an unskilled man named Ogiko as 1000-man commander of The Yi Huan army, he replied "Gyahaha cause it's funny obviously."

He also has a cool demeanor and almost never displays any shock no matter how bad the situation is. Yi Huan also shows a very dark side as he toys with Xi Bai Gui by dangling the idea of escape from death if he begged for his life then stabbed him several times after he refused to grovel.

He does exhibits a sense of loyalty exclusive to Ao Meng by holding the rank of Vice General in his army and coming when summoned as demonstrated when Tang Zhang used Ao Meng's name, as he knew that Yi Huan would simply ignore an request for a conversation with him.

__Special Skill:__ Latte art

Kanon is seen as being somewhat shy and flustered, admitting that she is not good at communicating in front of others. However, while walking in town Kanon would often listen to music on her headphones, and would usually find herself singing the words to a song. Although she yearns to sing in front of people, Kanon is particularly nervous about doing so. Despite seeing herself as being very ordinary - having no particular talents or aspirations for her life - Kanon wishes to cheer people up through her favorite songs.

Kanon, despite being more shy than previous protagonists, has nonetheless a natural charisma and people orientation. She is very kind-hearted, friendly, cheerful, passionate and supportive.

Ren Hazuki is a main character in Love Live! Superstar!!. She is currently a third year student at Yuigaoka Girls' High School. She is a first-generation member of Liella! and a member of the sub-unit KALEIDOSCORE. Her image color is sapphire blue.

Ren is polite and speaks with a very formal tone, although she is not quite used to handling casual conversations. Having been told as a child to refrain from spending too much time online, she also has difficulty communicating on camera. But considering that Ren is a fairly disciplined individual who manages her time well, she could easily dispense with any form of small talk. Ren believes that she mainly takes after her own mother, given her own unwavering commitment towards making Yuigaoka the number one school in her city.

While she was a bit too serious at first, Ren mellows out since joining Liella! and shows her true personality; she's certainly responsible and diligent, but also friendly, kind, and good-natured, also showing quite a playful streak. She also seems to have quite the naïve side to her, shown through her curiosity and innocence of video games and many other things. She's easily slightly embarrassed about these traits, her formal tone sometimes falling apart. Overall, she is still very responsible, reliant, resilient, and one for order, and is accepted by the members of Liella! and those who respect her.

Chisato is very kind, sweet, loyal and supportive towards Kanon - and later all the other group members. Although she describes herself as having a friendly and congenial personality, Chisato admits that others would find her "scary" whenever she gets angry - a thought that rarely crosses her mind. She loves to converse with her friends and go shopping together. Chisato is also very well-attuned to the latest news and rumors traveling within her school, seemingly to the extent that she might one day become Yuigaoka's official gossip girl.
  성우: Nako Misaki

Shiki isn't very fond of loud places. Her favorite things are Mei, stag beetles and butterflies. She appears to have a calm demeanor and is quiet most of the time. She also does not smile much, but the reason why is yet to be determined. She is also very conscious of her surroundings, as she easily noticed Mei looking at her from the Science Club room while she is with the other Liella! members at the rooftop.

-등장인물-
  이름: Shuutarou Mendou
  특징: Shuutaro Mendo is heir to the Mendou Zaibatsu with staggering wealth and its own private army. He commutes to school in a gigantic helicopter that is more like a flying mansion. Shuutaro carries a samurai sword which he often tries to use on Ataru (who has become expert at blocking it with his bare hands). Although very handsome he is just as stupid and lecherous as Ataru (just much more sophisticated in his approach). He takes his role as heir to the vast Mendou fortune extremely seriously. Mendou is vain, narcissistic, charming, overly dramatic, claustrophobic and afraid of the dark. He loves Lum, tolerating the presence of Ataru in order to be close to her. Shinobu is the closest thing he has to a girlfriend.  (Source: Wikipedia)
  성우: Mamoru Miyano

  이름: Ataru Moroboshi
  특징: A student at Tomobiki High School, Class 2-4, Ataru suffers from an incredible amount of bad luck, having been born on the unluckiest day of the Bhuddist calendar. He is very lecherous, stupid, and lazy. Though he often tries to escape from Lum and flirts with other women, he really does have feelings for her. Ataru's main goal in life is to live in the center of a harem composed of exotic and beautiful women (including Lum and most of her alien friends). His pick-up techniques would creep out most stalkers. Usually, he just walks up to a woman he's never met before and asks for her name, phone number, and address. Once he decides to go after a particular female, virtually no force on Earth (or from outer space) can stop him. He refused to admit it but, deep down, he proved in the later episodes that it was Lum that he truly loved.
  성우: Hiroshi Kamiya

  이름: Oyuki
  특징: Oyuki is the queen of Neptune, which in the series is a frozen, snowy planet populated entirely by women, as most of the men have to go off-planet to find work. As a child she used to hang out with Lum, Ran, and Benten when they were all in grade school. She is clearly patterned after the yuki-onna (literally "snow woman") of Japanese folklore. As such, she has the power to control and create ice, snow, and extreme cold. Typically dressed in a long, elegant kimono, Oyuki is soft-spoken, regal in demeanor and very slow to show anger. However, once roused to actually display her abilities she proves to be the most powerful character in the series. Because of the wrath she displays when angered, Oyuki is the only person in the entire galaxy that Ran genuinely fears.
  성우: Saori Hayami

  이름: Sakuranbou
  특징: Sakura's wandering monk uncle. Cherry's real name is Sakuranbou, which literally means “cherry” in Japanese. But because the word's kanji can be read to mean "deranged monk," a phrase that is quite accurate in describing him, he prefers to be called by the English word. Cherry has amazing spiritual powers (or so he claims) and he often predicts doom for Ataru (no great feat). He has a habit of popping up out of nowhere, often from very strange places. His ugly face and very short stature are frequently used for comedic effect. Cherry has made a vow of asceticism, living in a tent in an empty lot not far from Ataru's house. However, this vow apparently doesn't apply to food, as he is an enormous mooch. Rei Hino of Sailor Moon's Grandpa looks a lot like Cherry.

  성우: Wataru Takagi

  이름: Shinobu Miyake
  특징: Ataru's childhood friend and classmate. Until Lum showed up she was also Ataru’s girlfriend. She is a neat, clean, sweet, and petite young lady who can be viewed as the archetypically perfect Japanese female. Not long after Lum showed up Shinobu began to develop super-human strength. She like all female members of her class has a huge crush on Mendou. She is often part of a "foursome" consisting of Ataru, Lum, Shuutaro, and herself.    

~!By the end of the series, she'd given up on Shuutaro, thinking herself a likely "old maid", until she met a young boy named Inaba who sweeps her off her feet (eventually).!~  (source:Wikipedia)

-등장인물-
  이름: Miwa Kurushima
  특징: A recurring character, Miwa is sometimes a customer, sometimes a narrator.    Miwa initially comes to Eden Hall to ask Ryū to define what spirit was contained within a bottle she broke during her childhood. Miwa, when she was little, was shown to be the only child of the family. Her father decided one day, that he&#039;d propose to Miwa&#039;s grandfather to change the inn that he has been running into a fully-comfortable hotel-like bar, due to the change in era and customer&#039;s requests. However, Miwa&#039;s grandfather was hesitant, and decided not to take in his son&#039;s proposal. They later became apart and distant from each other, until the day came when Miwa&#039;s father called her grandfather and asked him to taste a special drink that he would like to present to him. On that fateful day that Miwa broke the glass as she gripped the bottle and ran towards her grandfather. She tripped and the bottle, which was encased in a bag, broke and its contents spilled. Miwa felt guilty as she thought if only they had the drink together, her father and grandfather wouldn&#039;t be apart like they used to. Not long after that, Miwa&#039;s parents were killed in a car accident, and this has halted her chance of ever finding out the name of that special drink. After much discussion with Ryū, the mystery of the drink was solved, and Miwa had the chance to finally allow her grandfather to have a taste. The drink was Suntory&#039;s Kakubin (referred to in the show as &quot;Kaku&quot;), and shortly after this episode, Miwa appears almost in every other episode as a side or minor character, and she usually narrates part of the story. She has been known to be a regular visitor at Eden Hall, and has invited one of her friends to the bar. In episode 7, Miwa takes care of Ryū after he has fallen sick, although she was unable to fetch a doctor. In the manga version of Bartender, Miwa works for Kamishima, the first customer featured in the anime. (Wikipedia)
  성우: Yoshino Nanjou

  이름: Ryuu Sasakura
  특징: Ryuu is a young bartender/bar-owner who has an incredible way of telling what a person is thinking and feeling, and what they want (and often need) to drink. That ability mixed with his kind, honest personality makes him the ultimate bartender. He is a genius bartender who helps the people who come into his bar. Although not thoroughly explained at first, Ryuu actually runs the bar by himself, and Eden Hall was his first bar. He worked as an assistant for a senior bartender before he opened Eden Hall, and that gave him the experience he needed to handle the job.

Kyoichiro is the oldest son and most powerful spy in the Yozakura Family. After a certain mission, where his younger sister and head of the Yozakura Family, [Mutsumi Yozakura](https://anilist.co/character/162724/) was badly injured, Kyoichiro swore to protect from there on out, no matter the cost.

Kyoichiro is a sister-loving freak. Practically a stalker and would do anything to protect his little sister, Mutsumi. He is very over-protective of her, and won't let any single boy come near her by any means possible; torture, threat, blackmail, murder, etc. Considered annoying by many people, and was once nominated by the Weekly Spies as 'The Spy I Would Want to Kill Most!'. Kyoichro most definitely wants to kill or torture [Taiyo Asano](https://anilist.co/character/162723/) as much as possible. But despite his torturous nature towards Taiyo, Kyoichiro is still reliable, and will protect whoever is close to him even if he dies in the process.

It was after that day that his personality and made him afraid of forming emotional connections with anyone. The only person who he stayed close with was [Mutsumi Yozakura](https://anilist.co/character/162724/Mutsumi-Yozakura) because of her promise to never leave him.

Without his weapons of choice, Shinzo seems useless and cowards in fear and distress. He gives off a different, more serious vibe as if he is focused on something important when armed.

제목 (원문): 青の祓魔師 島根啓明結社篇
줄거리: New TV anime series of Ao no Exorcist.

At True Cross Academy, Rin Okumura unknowingly comes across the first signs that something is amiss; ordinary people have been gaining the ability to perceive the invisible creatures that roam the human realm, Assiah. While Rin sees this as an opportunity to make a new friend, his twin brother, Yukio, is more burdened than ever. Swamped with his education, exorcist duties, and teaching position, Yukio has remained silent about his awakened powers, unable to understand their scale or significance.

While Rin and his friends prepare for the annual Exorcist Certification Exam, the True Cross Order has uncovered the first artificial gate to the demonic realm of Gehenna. Witnessing its size and the advanced technology that made it possible, the exorcists realize they are now dealing with the Illuminati, an extremely wealthy and powerful organization. Moreover, the inscrutable Illuminati have planted three spies in the True Cross Order—and one may be hiding among the aspiring exorcists sworn to protect mankind from the demonic threat.

-등장인물-
  이름: Yukio Okumura
  특징: __Height:__ 180 cm (5' 11") 

Yukio is Rin Okumura's twin and younger brother and Shiro Fujimoto's adopted son. He is a Middle First Class Exorcist who has started his training to become an Exorcist at seven by his father suggestion and, since then, gained the titles of Dragoon and Doctor at only fourteen, becoming the youngest Exorcist in the True Cross Order history. Yukio is also the youngest teacher of the True Cross' Exorcist Cram School, at which he teaches pharmacology. Before he was born, he has had a weak body that couldn't bear the power of the blue flames, causing the power of Satan to be fully inherited by Rin. He is seen as an ​example and prodigy by the ones who live together with him and is friends with Shiemi Moriyama, who calls him Yuki-chan.
  성우: Jun Fukuyama

  이름: Ryuuji Suguro

He is Rin's rival and the prodigy in the class. He was the child of the Cursed Temple which was destroyed by Satan 16 years ago. Bon takes everything seriously and is trying his hardest in order to become an Exorcist powerful enough so he could one day defeat Satan ( a goal he claims Rin stole from him) and rebuild his Temple. Currently Bon is trying to acquire the title of Meister in both Aria (a person who recites holy texts to kill certain demons) and Dragoon (a person who fights with heavy artillery). He is currently an Exwire. He is good at memorization, cleaning and Zen meditation.

  성우: Kazuya Nakai

  이름: Rin Okumura
  특징: __Height:__ 173 cm (5'8")

The fifteen-year-old protagonist of the story, Rin is the son of Satan born from a human woman and is the inheritor of Satan's powers.

  이름: Shiemi Moriyama
  특징: __Height:__ 165 cm (5' 4")    

Slightly allergic to pollen. Shiemi is Rin's classmate and friend. Before she met Rin, Shiemi tended her grandmother's garden while her mother ran an Exorcist only shop inside True Cross Academy. During her encounter with Rin and Yukio, they were able to discover that Shiemi was having her life force leached out by a Demon. After Yukio exorcised the demon, Shiemi finally decided to become an Exorcist and started to attend class. It was later revealed that Shiemi had talent in becoming a Tamer, as she was able to summon a Greenman Spirit during class. It is apparently a rare talent to possess amongst the Exorcists, where there are only a few who can control demons and fight.
  성우: Kana Hanazawa

  이름: Renzou Shima

Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-LYh3qCNZU
-등장인물-
  이름: Seiya
  특징: Seiya was trained to become a Saint of Athena, who is in charge of protecting the Earth from some of the other gods who would take it as part of their domain. Those gods include Hades, Artemis, and Poseidon. Seiya fights very tough battles but ends up successful through the help of his friends and his love for the Earth and his devotion to Athena. His determination has led to his overpowering gods.  In Saint Seiya: Omega,he wears the Sagittarius cloth.
  성우: Masakazu Morita

  이름: Shun
  특징: Perhaps the most reluctant of the bronze saints, Shun is the official Bronze Saint of the Andromeda constellation. He is a merciful soul by nature, and a firm believer in solving problems without causing bloodshed. This creates a sharp contrast between himself and the rest of the Saints: Whereas they will not hesitate to battle when the situation demands it, Shun only allows himself to fight if it's an absolute necessity, or when his almost endless patience wears off. When any of these things happen, Shun becomes an extremely vicious fighter.

Shun comes off rather badly in the Movies and 'Asgard' arc. In almost every fight scene, he almost always loses, and needs his brother Ikki to rescue him (except against Mizar Zeta Syd, the one time Shun defeated a foe in either the Movies or 'Asgard' story).

However, in the 'Sanctuary', 'Poseidon' and 'Hades' storylines, Shun comes off as a good, if reluctant fighter. In 'Sanctuary', he manages to hold his own against Gemini Saga, and even manages to kill Pisces Aphrodite, both of them Gold Saints. In 'Poseidon', he acquits himself nicely, defeating Io, the Southern Pacific Mariner General of Scylla, and Sorrento, the Southern Atlantic Mariner General of Siren. In 'Hades', he manages to dispatch various opponents. As a result, he comes off looking much better in these arcs than in the Movies or 'Asgard'; though he may be reluctant to fight, he will when he has to, and is just as powerful or skilled as any of the other main Bronze Saints (Shiryu, Hyoga, etc.)

  성우: Satomi Satou

  이름: Saga
  특징: __Nationality:__ Greek
__Class:__ Saint
__Loyalty:__  ~!Athena (good side), Himself (evil side)!~
__Cloth:__ Gemini
__Rank:__ Gold
__Training:__ Greece
__Height:__ 1.88 m
__Secret moves:__ Galaxian Explosion, Another Dimension, Demon Emperor Fist First appearance:  ~!Manga: chapter 1, vol.1 (as the Pope) manga: chapter 42, vol.12 (as Gold Saint) Anime: ep.1 (as the Pope) Anime: ep.71 (as Gold Saint)!~   Kurumada described Saga and Kanon in his manga (vol.7) as being extremely beautiful. This was probably a reference he made to the myth associated to the Gemini Constellation, which represents Castor and Pollux, brothers of Helen of Troy.   ~!Along with Leo Aiolia, Saga disguised as the Pope was the first Gold Saint that Masami Kurumada introduced in his manga, although their rank was revealed until later volumes. In his first appearance, Saga presided the event in which Pegasus Seiya acquired the status of Saint. In the anime adaptation, he was introduced in identical manner, in episode 1.  Saga served as the main antagonist for the Sanctuary arc. Being an excellent strategist, Saga managed to put himself in control of the sanctuary (though unfairly) for many years. Before the final showdown between himself and Pegasus Seiya, Saga was portrayed as a mysterious being with his facial features hidden from view.  Saga is often described by other characters as someone with the kindness of an angel but with the darkness of a demon. This ambivalence ended up creating a split personality: a good Saga that was extremely loyal to Athena and an evil one that keep the control of the body most of the time and killed the previous Pope to steal his place. Sometimes it is hinted that the creation of his "bad" personality had the influence of some external force, although nothing was clearly stated.  When it takes the control of Saga's body, his hair turn from blond to jet-black (the color schemes were altered for the anime, in which Saga's normally blue hair turned light grey). Saga's two "sides", can also communicate between them : in a dialogue the good Saga reproaches his evil "side" to have forced him to hurt Athena.!~  (Source: Wikipedia)
  성우: Ryoutarou Okiayu

  이름: Shiryu
  특징: Out of all five main characters, Shiryu is known as the calmest and most collected. His sheer physical strength is the greatest of the bronze saints, with perhaps the exception of Phoenix Ikki.This is reflected in his ability to have won numerous battles without his Dragon cloth. Shiryu trained at the Five Old Peaks in China to obtain the bronze cloth of the Dragon constellation, and his mentor was none other than senior gold saint, Libra Dohko.   Shiryu sports a large tattoo-like image of a green and white dragon on his back (however it is said in the manga and the anime that it is not a tattoo but is connected to his guardian dragon star and only appears as his cosmo is rising). Whenever his life is in danger, the tattoo-like image begins to fade away—once it completely vanishes, it is a sign that Shiryu's cosmos is nearing zero—as in death.
  성우: Takahiro Sakurai

  이름: Hyoga
  특징: One of the truly interesting main characters in the series, Hyoga appears calm, collected, and unemotional. Beneath the surface, however, he is passionate and devoted to his ideals.

The one person that forever lives in Hyoga mind is his deceased mother. She died when Hyoga was still very young, having drowned during the shipwreck of a doomed cruise. The ship sunk into the icy ocean, where the extreme cold kept Hyoga's mother from rigor mortis. Throughout the Sanctuary arc, Hyoga is shown to visit his mother periodically by diving into the waters.

줄거리: The anime will adapt the "Countermeasures Committee" arc.

The city's academies are divided into their own districts and are considered mostly independent.

The General Student Council acts as governing board to manage the academies as a whole. However, the group's ability to govern has come to halt since the mysterious disappearance of the General Student Council president. Countless issues have begun to surface throughout Kivotos in the absence of the president's leadership.

To avoid disaster, the General Student Council requests assistance from the Federal Investigation Club, otherwise known as Schale. In fact, Schale is the city's newest club and the last to be approved before the president's disappearance.

To accomplish its task, Schale relies on the guidance of a Sensei who can help them resolve the incidents around Kivotos. (Students are required to carry personal weapons and smart phones! Get a taste of the military action, love, and friendship the Academy City has to offer!) (Source: Anime News Network, Nexon, edited)

Kiwi frequently fantasizes about going to a love hotel with Utena. Despite appearances she is decent enough academically to help Utena avoid her grades deteriorating.

  이름: Utena Hiiragi

During the Five Story Ring battles, he shows that his Choujin Tamashii (超人魂, Superman Spirit) exceeds that of a Choujin by defeating Sunshine in a tremendous victory. Afterwards he passes the trial of the Superman Road (スーパーマンロード) and becomes a true Choujin, later participating in the Universal Choujin Tag Tournament and the Survivor Match for the Kinniku Throne. He is usually seen carrying a tomahawk and a hunting knife with him, but he hardly ever uses them. Nisei character Chaos appears to look up to him, as they are both humans fighting alongside Choujin.

  특징: Starting out as a recurring villain, Robin Mask soon became one of the most essential members of the Seigi Choujin (Justice Supermen) team. Robin wore knight-type armor made out of sapphire (later remade out of steel), and wearing the armor reduced his strength, giving his opponent a fair chance at beating him. Although Robin is only a few years older than most of the cast he is considered the veteran of the group and often comes up with the teams' overall battle plan. In the anime he is depicted as wearing a blue undershirt underneath his armor, making it seem at times that he has blue skin.  (Source: Wikipedia)

When she was younger, she was disappointed with the lack of motivation from her classmates and this made her realize how ignorant they were, which created an unconscious condescension within her. Once she realized that, she drew a line in order to avoid any conflict with those around her, making her feel distant and reserved to others. For better or worse she doesn't rely on anyone.

-등장인물-
  이름: Natsuha Arisugawa
  특징: __Height:__ 168 cm
__Hometown:__ Aichi

A hot-blooded young woman, Natsuha's life motto is to work as hard as possible to be the best person you can be. Though born to a wealthy family, she wants all of her success in life to be a product of her own efforts.

She can see the true potential of everyone around her and likes to motivate her friends to achieve it. She is proud of her family name and trains on a daily routine to make sure she is not ashamed of that title. She is a second year in University, where she studies economics.
  성우: Akiho Suzumoto

  이름: Meguru Hachimiya
  특징: __Height:__ 157 cm
__Hometown:__ Massachusetts, USA
__Hobbies:__ Talking with people, Doing physical exercises

Born to an American mother and a Japanese father, she's a returnee girl who moved back to Japan in her 3rd year of elementary school. With a charming personality and adorable smile, she's an energetic beauty. She expresses her emotions strongly and loves making others happy. Because she puts others before herself, she makes friends easily. In her worldview, "friendship" is the most important thing, so she'll carve out time for her friends no matter how busy she is. Because she has that kind of personality, she hates being alone and succumbs to loneliness easily. She's very grabby with people she's close to. As a result, she's confessed to by boys often, but she always turns them down because, in her words "I don't really understand romance yet". She hates studying, but she loves exercise and all kinds of sports! Basketball, volleyball, swimming, track and field... She's in 4 different sports teams, so her days are quite busy. Meguru loves the word "youth", and is a hot-blooded girl at her core!

Meguru is an athletic extrovert who's always bursting with energy. She's quite popular at her high school for her looks and charm, and balances her social life and sports with her idol work seemingly flawlessly. Unlike [Mano](https://anilist.co/character/136823/Mano-Sakuragi) and [Hiori](https://anilist.co/character/136822/Hiori-Kazano), Meguru doesn't seem to have any sort of insecurities about her own capacities and the unit as a whole, and tends to help them with their worries since they tend to doubt themselves. However, Meguru seems to get lonely easily and dislikes to work alone. She is a first year in high school.

Meguru is good at talking to other people, but sometimes she has an unique way of expressing herself. Since she's good at making friends, Meguru sometimes helps Hiori (who is a shy person) to talk to Mano and gives tips on how she usually acts with her friends.
  성우: Mayu Mineda

  이름: Hiori Kazano
  특징: __Height:__ 154 cm
__Hometown:__ Tokyo
__Hobbies:__ Music, Looking for beautiful scenery, Fortune telling

Gorgeous and clear-headed, like an unreachable beauty. Her charm is that she's more stoic than anyone else, but also more pure-hearted than anyone else. It's just that her habit of saying exactly what she's thinking means she's easily misunderstood and makes enemies easily. She hates that part of herself most of all, and isn't proud of it. Additionally, when she unintentionally hurts someone's feelings, she can fall into a depression due to her sensitive side.

While Hiori comes off initially as harsh and stoic, in reality she just struggles opening up and socializing with others, which can lead to misunderstandings sometimes. Even if she sounds harsh sometimes, she is a really kind girl. Because of this, she treasures every friend she makes.
  성우: Reina Kondou

  이름: Amana Oosaki
  특징: __Height:__ 159 cm
__Hometown:__ Toyama
__Hobbies:__ Shopping, Nails, Selfies

Tenka's younger twin sister. Amana is a selfless girl who wants the best for everyone around her - even if it means neglecting her own wishes. A fashionable and extroverted gyaru, she appears to be the polar opposite of her twin, Tenka, but they love each other more than anyone can possibly know. She likes to put all her effort into enjoying things that she can't experience any other time. She is in her 2nd year of high school.
  성우: Honoka Kuroki

  이름: Mano Sakuragi
  특징: __Height:__ 155 cm
__Hometown:__ Tokyo, Japan
__Hobbies:__ Going out, Sun basking in the park

Mano is a gentle girl who you want to protect. Her catchphrases are “Howa~” and “Mun!”. Mano has a kind personality and rarely gets angry or gives her opinion without being asked, but she has a tendency to saddle herself with worries in secret... Raised close to nature since she was young, Mano loves spending her time relaxing in the park. When Mano visits the park birds tend to gather around her and she often loses track of time playing with them. Mano loves birds and has a pet pigeon named Pii-chan. Mano also loves shopping and going on excursions. However, Mano has a slight aversion to large crowds since she often gets pushed around. Social interaction isn't Mano’s strong suit, and she was scouted by Producer while she was wondering whether she’d be alright staying her shy self forever. While usually not the type to take initiative on her own, after being offered several times Mano came to think being an idol “could be a chance to change herself” and decided to become an idol. Mano is a part of the unit “illumination STARS”. She has great respect for her unit-mate [Hiori’s](https://anilist.co/character/136822/Hiori-Kazano) solemn devotion to lessons and idol work as well as her unit-mate [Meguru's](https://anilist.co/character/136821/Meguru-Hachimiya) ability to make friends with anyone.

A soft-spoken shy girl with a kind, genuine personality. Mano's gentle demeanor can soften even the most hardened heart due to her kindness towards everyone she meets.

-등장인물-
  이름: Emilia
  특징: **Height:** 164 cm (5'5")

She is a silver-haired half-elf girl who is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election. Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.

Emilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.
  성우: Rie Takahashi

On the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world. He has the ability that he calls "Return by Death" to go back in time when he dies. Despite being a hikikomori and gamer in his real world, Subaru does a bit of workout and seems to know basic hand-to-hand combat, making him not completely weak.

While Subaru tends to not read the situation, he is loyal to those he holds dear, willing to help them, even if that means taking the thorny path. He has his resolve confirmed through the many situations and circumstances he faces in the fantasy world, originally having been one to always take the "easy" route. As a hikikomori, he is hopeful of the possibilities that being sucked into a new realm brings, but later realizes the realities of the predicament he is in. Ultimately, he resolves himself to be faithful and protective of the ones that he cares most about.

  성우: Satomi Arai

  이름: Ram
  특징: __Height:__ 154 cm (5’1”)

Ram is one of the twin maids working for Roswaal L Mathers. She has medium length light pink hair that covers her left eye, large darkish pink eyes, and young features. She also has hair clips towards right side of her hair, flower-shaped ribbon on the same side of her hair, and a maid hairband. She looks nearly identical to her sister Rem apart from her hair, eyes, and ribbon coloring. She usually wears a maid uniform. She has a smaller chest compared to her sister, and she has slanted eyes. Ram is seemingly self-centered and does things at her own pace, however in actuality she maintains a distance from people to ascertain them. She believes that Roswaal is the greatest and no one else is as precious except for her sister Rem. She is slightly more outgoing in comparison to the generally taciturn Rem, who generally allows Ram to take the lead in their sisterly bond.
~! As the prodigal elder twin Ram was born with extraordinary talent for mana manipulation and a powerful body to match that made her the pride of the Oni village. Her aptitude didn't just lie there, everything from cooking to physical activities she was superior to Rem and was showered in adoration even by her own sister. However she never let any of it get to her head and never forgot her little sister no matter how much attention was paid to her. During the night of the attack by the Witch Cult when all the Oni fell she alone kept fighting to avenge them and protect her sister. But the cult outnumbered her and she made a last ditch effort to shield a petrified Rem from getting cut down. In mere moments, Ram lost her horn when it was sliced off from her head as a result of that. Had it not been for a passing mage at the time whom they came to know as Roswaal L Mathers they would not have survived the massacre.
The next several years since then Roswaal would gain the twins eternal gratitude and fervent loyalty. Especially in the case of Ram who came to harbor romantic feelings for him who also served as her lifeline due to regular mana infusions. During the early days of her life in Roswaal's mansion Ram would also come to know the partial truth of the cult's raid that night as well as the identity of the cult member responsible for cutting off her horn, Faust with assistance from Roswaal and achieved her vengeance. Ram is the only person who knows about Roswaal's gospel and had formed a contract with him that stipulated that his life would be hers if the future ever deviated from it's predictions as penance for knowing about the attack and letting it happen for his own ends. !~

  이름: Rem
  특징: __Height:__ 154 cm (5'1")

Rem is one of the twin maids working for Roswaal L Mathers. She has medium length sky blue hair that covers her right eye, large light blue eyes, and young features. She also has hair clips towards left side of her hair, flower-shaped ribbon on the same side of her hair, and a maid hairband. She looks nearly identical to her sister apart from her hair, eyes, and ribbon coloring. She usually wears a maid uniform, and since her chest is slightly larger than her sister's, she secretly changes the measurements to hide it. Rem tends to speak in a superficially polite manner and sometimes acts without thinking. She holds both respect to the point of worship and guilt toward her sister for an incident in the past. Because of her respect and guilt toward her sister, she used to think of herself as inferior.

Ryoma is a first year student at Seishun Academy ('Seigaku' for short), which he attends immediately after his arrival in Japan after formerly residing in the United States. Although only a first year in middle school, Ryoma had already earned notoriety through winning four consecutive titles in the American Junior Tennis tournaments – all in a little over a year. Due to his nearly invincible tennis play, Ryoma has earned the label 'prodigy' by the age of twelve. His looks and confidence make him highly popular with ladies, although he seems not to notice, having his focus exclusively on tennis.  He is an all-court tennis player with many special shots and abilities. One of Ryoma's greatest talents is his ability to learn new techniques after only seeing them performed a few times. He also has an amazing amount of stamina and does not sweat as much as other players. Along with fellow Seigaku regular [Eiji Kikumaru](https://anilist.co/character/328/Eiji-Kikumaru), Ryoma is known to have an exceptional talent for seeing moving objects. He does not go easy on himself and pushes himself more, rather than letting himself rest. He is specifically a singles player, though he did try doubles once with teammate [Momoshiro Takeshi](https://anilist.co/character/331/Takeshi-Momoshiro).

He reforms in the anime after being beaten by Fuji, though he retains his nature in the manga; in the nationals in the anime, he returns to his violent playing style. While under high pressure or after sustaining injury, The whites of his eyes turn red, becoming bloodshot, and his power, skill, and speed increase. He becomes much more violent while in this state. Later, he develops a "Devil Mode", which turns his skin red and his hair white. His bloodlust and destructive power are greatly enhanced, and he solely focuses on crushing the opposing players using purely violent means.

After Mash Burnedead's clash with Magia Lupus, the secret about his powers is now out in the open.

However, an evil shadow organization called Innocent Zero hijacks the inquiry to demand that Mash be kept alive.

Mash proves that he is capable of dealing with Innocent Zero, but the Divine Visionaries' verdict remains unchanged. Luckily, Mash finds unexpected allies in Divine Visionary Rayne Ames and Headmaster Wahlberg Baigan, and they successfully defer his execution until Innocent Zero is defeated. Mash is now allowed to live under one condition: he must be selected as the Divine Visionary candidate by the year's end.

-등장인물-
  이름: Madara
  특징: A mysterious feline spirit. Madara was sealed in a shrine until he was accidentally released by Natsume. Because Madara was trapped in a material form for so long, Madara ordinary takes on the shape of a maneki neko (lucky cat), leading Natsume to nickname him Nyanko-sensei. In this form, other people can see him, leading for Natsume having to ask his guardians if he could keep him as a pet.   Madara is a powerful spirit, who protects Natsume from others and teaches him spells on occasion, in return for Natsume's promise to give him the Book of Friends when he dies. They often fight each other, which leads to Natsume punching Madara on the face and knocking him out. Despite his protests of not being a cat, he likes to play with cat toys. Nyanko's design is based on a lucky cat statue Midorikawa was given as a child. In the anime, Natsume is more respectful to Madara.
  성우: Kazuhiko Inoue

  이름: Takashi Natsume
  특징: __Height:__ 167 cm (5'4")

Natsume Takashi is the main protagonist of the series who, like his deceased grandmother Natsume Reiko, has the ability to see ayakashi (spirits). He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed "Nyanko-sensei" (or simply "sensei"), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then.  

Orphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a 'liar' and 'attention seeker' for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively “normal” life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret.  

Natsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei.   To return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process.
  성우: Hiroshi Kamiya

  이름: Shuuichi Natori
  특징: __Height:__ 175cm 

A man who is also able to see spirits. He is a famous actor and exorcist and has a lizard birthmark that moves around on his body. He has the ability to manipulate paper dolls and has three youkai under his command. Natsume tends to disapprove of his forceful exorcism methods.
  성우: Akira Ishida

  이름: Reiko Natsume
  특징: __Family:__ Takashi Natsume (grandson), Takashi's Mother (daughter)

Reiko Natsume is the maternal grandmother of [Takashi Natsume](https://anilist.co/character/13783/Takashi-Natsume), and the person whom Takashi inherited his strong spiritual power from.

She was despised by both humans and youkai. She was a bully towards humans and youkai alike, resulting in her being socially isolated. She defeated many Youkai and made them write out their names in the Yuujinchou (translated into Book of Friends), making them "servants" to her. However, there are times she is kind to humans but they don't return the gesture. For instance, she had taken a doll from a pot youkai, Kayatsubo to return to a human child but they told her that she could keep it, believing she stole it.

Initially, her actions were presented as a desire to have control over youkai, but it's revealed that they were done more out of loneliness and longing for companionship. ~!She died young with no human willing to remember her with many youkai mistaking her grandson for her.!~ Some of the youkai she "enslaved" or made plans with grew to despise her, while some youkai (like Santou) continued to wait for her return.

제목 (원문): 黒執事 寄宿学校編
줄거리: Continuation of the Kuroshitsuji anime adaptation.

At the request of Queen Victoria, Earl Ciel Phantomhive goes to Weston College—a prestigious public academy for boys, known for its traditions and outstanding curriculum—to search for a relative of hers who has not returned home in months. Thanks to his noble status, the 13-year-old Ciel is swiftly able to enroll as a student, while his devilish butler Sebastian Michaelis assumes a teaching position at the school.

Ciel does not anticipate being unable to locate the Queen's relative on campus. To make matters worse, he cannot request a meeting with the headmaster of the college, who may be the only person that knows anything pertaining to the disappearance. The only ones in frequent contact with the headmaster are the heads of the college dormitories, known as the Prefect 4 (P4): Edgar Redmond, Lawrence Bluewer, Herman Greenhill, and Gregory Violet.

Ciel must concoct a plan to get in the P4's good graces if he wants to use their connections to succeed in his mission. But the distinguished college and its students hide much that is unseen, making this task more improbable than he could imagine.

-등장인물-
  이름: Ciel Phantomhive
  특징: __Race__: Human
__Height__: 152 cm (5") ~ 158 cm (5'2")  
__Afiliation__: Phantomhive Family, Faustian Contract, Funtom Company  
__Occupation__: Earl of Phantomhive, Watchdog of the Queen  
__Know Relatives__:  ~!Vincent Phantomhive (father, deceased), Rachel Phantomhive (mother, deceased), "Ciel Phantomhive" (twin brother), Angelina Durless (aunt, deceased), Frances Midford (aunt), Edward Midford (cousin), Elizabeth Midford (cousin, fiancée), Clause (uncle)!~  

The Phantomhive family has, for years, been well known for making toys and sweets for small children. However, they are also the Queen's watchdogs; the Phantomhive family keeps an eye on black market dealings in ways that Scotland Yard isn't able to. Ciel Phantomhive is the heir to this legacy.  Earl Ciel Phantomhive is the business-savvy, twelve-year-old (later thirteen-year-old) head of the English Phantomhive noble family, taking over after the deaths of his parents, Lord Vincent and Lady Rachel Phantomhive. He also runs Funtom Company, which manufactures toys and sweets, and later adds a food branch after winning a Royal Warrant. His right eye, which is usually covered with a black eyepatch, bears a pentacle sign of the Faustian contract which binds the demon Sebastian Michaelis to his will. He also has a brand burnt into his back from when he was sold as a slave after his house was burnt down. Ciel is engaged to his cousin, Elizabeth Middleford. He sees her as an important friend and someone he needs to protect. His parents were killed and his mansion was set ablaze on his birthday, a reason why he does not like to celebrate the occasion. This tragedy causes him to not want to lose anyone important again. Despite his young age, he runs the family company and, as such, is quite busy much of the time though he still finds time to go out investigating dubious legal matters.   

Throughout the series, Ciel's height has been used as a tool of mockery due to his short stature. He grows by 6 cm in the second season, but still remains shorter than the other characters, thus continuing the comical relief. Sebastian enjoys teasing Ciel about this fact. In the manga he does not grow taller.  The young earl is far more composed and mature than would be expected. He remains distant from others, aloof, preferring to spend his time on work for the company.  He is oftentimes selfish and not able to fully empathize with people. However, he does express occasional concern for the well-being of those close to him.  As a side note, Ciel seems to enjoy drinking tea a lot (he is adept at distinguishing between them as well) and sweet desserts. He has asthma (inherited from his mother) and dislikes being around cats because they trigger his allergies.
  성우: Maaya Sakamoto

  이름: Sebastian Michaelis
  특징: __Height:__ 185 cm (6'1")

Sebastian Michaelis is the series' antihero. He is the butler of the Phantomhive household and acts as Ciel's bodyguard, two jobs he is completely devoted to.  He is highly skilled in any area and handles every task, no matter how impossible it is as well as any problem that arises from the errors of the other staff with ease, stating it is only natural as the butler to the Phantomhive family. This is due to the fact he is a demon bound by a Faustian contract to abide by Ciel's will.

Following the faceless god Hitogami's advice seems to have worked wonders for Rudeus Greyrat. After enrolling into the University of Magic as he was told, Rudeus reunites with his childhood friend Sylphiette, who put a valiant effort into curing his condition. The two grow ever closer together and decide to host a wedding party, inviting the friends they have made over the years to announce and formalize their relationship.

For all his recent blessings, however, Rudeus' troubles are far from over. The research he is helping Shizuka Nanahoshi conduct hits a bottleneck, sending her into a deep slump much like he experienced in his previous life. Furthermore, a letter from his father, Paul, brings complications to Rudeus' relationships, and Sylphiette still knows next to nothing about his real background. In the face of these issues, Rudeus will have to apply the lessons he has learned in this new world to navigate through the challenges that come with living a life to its fullest.

Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RSPJDwoaoQ
-등장인물-
  이름: Doraemon
  특징: Doraemon is a robotic cat (though he is frequently mistaken as a tanuki) that was sent back in time to help Nobita.  He has a 4-dimensional pocket on his front chest from which he can pull out all sorts of strange futuristic gadgets. Doraemon's favourite food is dorayaki. He has a sister named Dorami.
  성우: Wasabi Mizuta

  이름: Nobita Nobi
  특징: Nobita is a fourth grader in Tokyo and only child. He is lazy, bad in sports, bad in school, plain as a gray rock, and to top it off, all too unlucky in his (mis)adventures with Doraemon. However, his struggles to overcome his flaws are what drive the storyline.
  성우: Megumi Oohara

  이름: Shizuka Minamoto
  특징: Shizuka is the smart, kind, and pretty neighborhood girl who is the object of Nobita's affections. She takes baths several times a day. Nobita often disrupts her in the bath due to some misuse of Doraemon's gadgets, resulting in Nobita's head getting dunked. She is also known for taking piano lessons unwillingly, which is sometimes used as an excuse for declining to hang out with Nobita. Her true passions are sweet potatoes, which she'd rather keep to herself out of the knowledge of others, and the violin, in which her playing is as atrocious as Gian's singing. Due to Doraemon's intervention, Shizuka will become Nobita's wife in the future timeline, and the mother of his son.
  성우: Yumi Kakazu

  이름: Takeshi Gouda
  특징: Takeshi, usually known by the nickname "Gian" (ジャイアン, Jaian?) from English word "giant", is the big, strong, and quick-tempered local bully. He is known for his confidence in his terrible singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. He regularly subjects the neighborhood children to horrendous singing recitals, which is sometimes combined with his equally bad homemade dinner and his atrocious fashion sense. He also frequently steals other children's toys and books under the pretext of "borrowing" them, unless the toy is damaged. This is how most fans considered Gian to be the antagonist of this show. However, he does not hesitate to help Nobita and his friends when they are in real trouble, which often occurs in the movies. Several of the stories revolve around Nobita and his friends' efforts to avoid Gian's concerts, and several chapters summarize his friends efforts to avoid visiting Gian's house on his birthday because of his selfish nature. After reflecting on one event about his birthday, Gian thought of himself why he wasn't popular among his peers. After getting a lecture from Doraemon to see what an unruly character he is, Gian realize that he should have been a better person and he begs Doraemon to give him another chance. However, things didn't go exactly as planned when his friends at school or at the streets mock him to see how weird Gian was acting and get kicked by Suneo after learning his attempt to become gentle to his peers. This led him to lose control of his temper and start attacking his friends again. Although he bullies the other children (mostly Nobita), he is terrified of his mother, who runs the local grocery store, a fact Nobita and Doraemon sometimes use in their favor. He founded his own baseball team named after himself. Although Nobita is often blamed for the losses against the baseball team's rival, the "Tyranos", Gian and Suneo still force Nobita to play because they do not have enough players. Gian also has a younger sister named Jaiko, whom he adores.
  성우: Subaru Kimura

  이름: Suneo Honekawa
  특징: Suneo is the fox-faced (inherited from his mother) rich kid who loves to flaunt his material wealth before everyone. He is often seen with Gian, serving as Gian's lackey while they bully Nobita together, though deep down he fears and despises him as much as everyone else. Some of the stories start with Suneo showing off some new video game or toy which evokes Nobita's envy. He has an extensive knowledge of science, and is a talented artist and designer. He has the habit to invite Gian and Shizuka to something or someplace, but always leave Nobita out with one excuse or another. In some scenes, Suneo is seen as a narcissist who loves to stare at himself in the mirror while telling himself that he is the most handsome guy in the world. He is still a bed-wetter and needs to wear diapers when he sleeps, despite being in the fourth grade. He considers this humiliating habit his secret weakness. Suneo is also very self-conscious about his height, being the shortest kid in his class.

-등장인물-
  이름: Sawako Kuronuma
  특징: __Height:__ 158 cm  (5'2")

Sawako is a shy and honest high school girl who in search of friendship, though her resemblance to Sadako from _The Ring_ makes this difficult.

Sawako tends to take things too literally and often over-analyzes situations. Her quiet nature makes it hard for her to socialize, and leads to her classmates spreading rumors and having negative misconceptions about her, to the point where many of them think her name is actually Sadako. Fortunately, Sawako is gradually able to open up to her classmates and talk to different people. With help from Kazehaya, Yano, and Yoshida, she gradually begins to make friends. 

~!When Kazehaya practically confessed right in front of her that he likes her, Sawako believes it was a misunderstanding and that he was just saying he doesn't hate her. However, after having everything cleared up they officially start dating, though this only brings up rumors that she somehow used black magic to get him.!~

~!Currently, she is studying to be a high school Japanese Language teacher at the University of Education with her rival and later best friend, Ume Kurumizawa.!~
  성우: Mamiko Noto

  이름: Shouta Kazehaya
  특징: __Height:__ 175 cm (5'9")

Kazehaya is Sawako's outgoing classmate and friend. He is so popular that during middle school, so many girls liked him that they formed a "Kazehaya is Everyone's" Alliance in order to maintain some level of peace among his admirers. Kazehaya has held a long standing interest in Sawako and admits (though not to Sawako) that he likes her, unaware that she feels the same for him.

~!During their second year of high school, he begins to wonder if she actually likes him after she does not give him chocolates on Valentine's Day, not knowing that she had been too nervous to give him any. He seemingly becomes depressed and shows an expressionless face often. However, after being confronted by Ryuu (influenced by Chizuru) and Pin, Kazehaya goes to Sawako as his friends jokingly remark that he likes Sawako; however, Kazehaya takes the remark seriously and agrees, subsequently confessing directly to Sawako. However, after Sawako's misunderstanding of his confession, he believes she rejected him. However, as of chapter 41 was finally able to confess his feelings to Sawako and are officially dating.!~
  성우: Daisuke Namikawa

  이름: Ayane Yano
  특징: __Height:__ 161 cm

Ayane is a close friend of Sawako. She is the arguably the most mature of the group and she has a boyfriend in college as well as having her ears pierced multiple times. Initially the mangaka conceived of Yano and Yoshida as a pair, and in the first two chapters the two are difficult to tell apart. She then redrafted the characters, combing Yano's hair and styling it in a fashion that looks like a pony-tail. In Kurumi's fake rumors, it is said that Ayane has played more with more than 100 guys in middle school. In their current high school, it is said that Yano and Yoshida pretty much have authority in the year group. Perceptive and intelligent, a trait of Ayane's personality is that she gives just enough information to leave others wondering, thus forcing them to move forward, this as well as being able to figure out that it was Ume who spread the rumors and discovering that Sawako "liked" Kazehaya. Although she is usually calm and collected, she is easily infuriated if someone hurts Sawako and does not hesitate to attack the one responsible she believes is responsible (frequently Kazehaya) with kicks and sharp words. She's also fairly intimidating when angry, being called scary by Chizuru a number of times. 

~!As of Chapter 20 she broke up with her boyfriend, who had begun to become too possessive of her: calling her all times of the day, wondering what she has been up to, and the fact if she was with any guys. After she suggested they break up, he slapped her across the face. When he tried to apologize and ask her back, she realizes that the man she liked was not her boyfriend but rather, who he was when they started dating.  Ayane had been a great friend to Sawako and Chizu, but still believes she isn't a kind person. In Chapter 45, when she confessed that she doesn't believe she is a kind person (compared to Sawako and Chizu) because of how cunning she can be in front of Pin, she dreads another full-of-himself lecture from a surprisingly quiet Pin, who instead stares at a candy she gave him because he was whining about not getting one after the festival. Then, Pin pats her on the head and reassures her that she is kind before walking up the stairs, leaving her speechless that he could actually show a serious side. Also, Kento shows attraction to her as well. However, on chapter 54, a guy named Motoki-kun from class B suddenly confessed to her and Ayane accepted it immediately (shown in chapter 55).!~
  성우: Miyuki Sawashiro

  이름: Chizuru Yoshida
  특징: __Height:__ 167 cm

Yoshida Chizuru is another close friend of Sawako. She is the energetic girl of the group.  ~!In Kurumi's fake rumors it was passed around that she was a former Yankee. She is a close childhood friend with Ryuu Sanada, who is also the son of the owner of her favorite ramen shop, they are best friends and they even say brothers, she argues about who is the older. She went to Kazehaya's middle school as well. She has a crush on Ryuu's brother, Tooru. Chizuru is mostly only the slower side of things; she did not realize that Kazehaya liked Sawako (even though she and Ayane planned many events for them) until late in the series, after the 2nd year in their school has started.!~
  성우: Yuuko Sanpei

  이름: Ryuu Sanada
  특징: __Height:__ 179 cm

Sanada Ryuu is also one of Sawako's new group. He is quiet most of the time, but can still communicate well with Sawako (as they both don't talk much anyways). He is a close childhood friend with Chizuru. He is also good baseball mates with Kazehaya since they both played together in middle school.   

~!He has had a crush on Chizuru since they were little.!~

줄거리: The story takes place in the town of Most City in a certain country. On the second floor of an old building is a publishing company that puts out a periodical called Delusional Monthly Magazine, a science magazine featuring articles about shocking, bizarre events and inexplicable phenomena that make even scientists throw up their hands in defeat.

As Kanata, his childhood friend Ellie, and the magus diva Ciel set out for Histoire, a hostile organization named Ideal sends assassins after them. If Kanata wants to stand a chance at accomplishing his dream, he must uncover the unpleasant truth about Ideal—and some of his closest allies.

-등장인물-
  이름: Ohma Tokita
  특징: Having grown up in the lawless territory known as The Inside, the young Ohma was found and adopted by Tokita Niko, who taught him his style of martial arts; the Niko Style. Ohma is a man of above-average height and has an extremely athletic build. His most notable trait is his mop of messy, dark hair that has been compared to seaweed. In addition, Ohma possesses a narrow gaze that exudes both confidence and general indifference.

Ohma is a rough, yet well-meaning individual. He was initially rather arrogant, which often surfaced whenever he fought. During his fights, he was condescending and often belittled and provoked his opponents. A defining trait of Ohma is his lust for battle; ever eager to fight against those who are strong. Despite this love for fighting, he will not fight those that refuse to fight him. Such was the case when Kazuo and his son had done so on separate occasions. That being said, he was also short-tempered and can be quite violent. He was willing to physically assault Hideki Nogi, his employer, when the latter refused to make him Nogi Group's representative fighter, before being stopped by Sen Hatsumi.
  성우: Tatsuhisa Suzuki

  이름: Cosmo Imai
  특징: Imai Cosmo, also known as The King of Stranglers, is one of the affiliated fighters employed for Nishihonji Security Services and also one of Nishihonji's Seven Fists. He represented Nishihonji Security Services during the Kengan Annihilation Tournament. Imai Cosmo has a very happy-go-lucky personality, and is almost always cheerful and smiling. He was called a social butterfly while in school for having friends across different cliques. He is easy to get along with and makes friends with several of the other fighters, even ones he has just fought. He is a quick learner, being flexible and adaptable.

As a child, Cosmo was getting into fights on the streets day in and day out, until he met Kureishi Mitsuyo, a mixed martial artist who offered to teach him martial arts. Cosmo proved to be a natural at it, so much so that when one of Kureishi's other students, a young businessman named Nishihonji Akira, came to recruit Kureishi to fight for his business, Kureishi instead referred him to Cosmo.

At the tender age of 14, Cosmo became the youngest person to ever debut in the Kengan matches, taking down a giant man 20cm taller and 30kg heavier into submission. He attended high school during most of his tenure as a fighter, and struggled to keep his brother and school friends from knowing about his rather unusual part-time job. At the age of 17, Nishihonji brought him to fight Anderson Arona, a public MMA fighter. Despite Arona's impressive win streak in Cage Fight, Cosmo ended up easily defeating him and causing Arona to retire from fighting altogether.

  이름: Gensai Kuroki
  특징: Gensai Kuroki is a renowned assassin in the criminal underworld and the affiliated fighter for Motorhead Motors in the Kengan Annihilation Tournament.
  성우: Tesshou Genda

  이름: Takeshi Wakatsuki
  특징: Wakatsuki Takeshi, also known as The Wild Tiger, is the affiliated fighter of Furumi Pharmaceuticals; he represented the company during the Kengan Annihilation Tournament. Takeshi is the longest-serving active affiliated Kengan fighter and has the highest win record of all affiliated fighters. Two years later he entered the Kengan Association VS Purgatory Tournament as a representative of the Kengan Association.

Takeshi is quiet, yet easy to befriend. He's highly analytical, making observations some people wouldn't notice. When fighting, he's incredibly ferocious, but will change his strategy at the last minute if needed. He values strength above most other things, though he is also humble and modest, and honestly admits to being nervous when entering a fight. Despite his calm-and-collected personality, Takeshi is also surprisingly sloppy.
  성우: Yasuyuki Kase

  이름: Agito Kanoh
  특징: Kanoh Agito was the affiliated fighter for Dainippon Bank and represented the company during the Kengan Annihilation Tournament; he was widely regarded as the most powerful fighter in the tournament and was the favorite to win. While still active, he was ranked #1 in the Kengan affiliated fighter ranks. He was the fifth holder of the title Fang of Metsudo.

~!After his defeat against Kuroki Gensai (The Devil Lance) in the Kengan Annihilation Tournament he retired as the Fang of Metsudo, but he hasn't stopped training as mentioned in the sequel of Kengan Ashura, Kengan Omega. He was convinced by Himuro Ryo to participate in the Kengan Association vs. Purgatory tournament. In the training Kanoh went trough in between Kengan Ashura and Omega he significantly reduced the lag in between switching from Formless to Martial Arts and the other way around, which was according to Kuroki Gensai, the man who defeated him his main weakness. This was mentioned by Kuroki during his fight in the Kengan Association vs Purgatory tournament.!~

~!During his fight against Lu Tian, who was his opponent in the Kengan Association vs Purgatory tournament, it was revealed that Kanoh Agito was a Gu Ritual survivor saved by Katahara Metsudo and used to be a disciple of Tokita Niko (Tiger Niko) who taught him Formless and partially taught him the Niko Style.!~

-등장인물-
  이름: Conan Edogawa
  특징: **Height:** 174 cm (as Shinichi)
 **Relatives:** Yusaku Kudo (father) & Yukiko Kudo (mother)

At the beginning of the series, Shinichi is a 17-year old student at Teitan High School. He is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the "Savior of the police force", for solving many difficult cases that the professionals could not. However, while investing 2 mysterious men, he is spotted and forced to swallow an experimental poison known as APTX 4869. This results in his body shrinking to that of a 6 year old.

Shinichi comes up with the alias Conan Edogawa after Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Rampo and pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa's who places Conan in Ran's care. Ran's father Kogoro Mouri, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization.

As Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogoro's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. By solving cases one after the other, he helps build up Kogoro's reputation who will later on be referred to as "Sleeping Kogoro". He also spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa.

  성우: Minami Takayama

  이름: Kaito Kuroba
  특징: The Phantom Thief Kid or The Magician Under the Moonlight (Kaito Kid) is a world-renowned thief who steals treasures and gems. He is sometimes known as Kaito Kid or 'International Criminal 1412'.   Despite the fact that Shinichi (Conan) does not care much about investigating thefts, Kid can be considered his archnemesis, as he is the one criminal (besides some members of the Black O) he can not seem to catch.   Curiously, Kaito discovers Conan's true identity (non-canon, movies only), but keeps his secret, and sometimes Conan can even count on Kid's help to solve some of his cases. However, not even Kudo Shinichi knows about Kid's true identity.   Throughout the story, Kaito Kid and Conan have crossed paths but he has always managed to escape from Conan's clutches by his special skills.    ~!Kaito is the son of the magician, Touichi Kuroba, and apparently knew Shinichi's mother. Touichi Kuroba also made clues for Shinichi and Ran, who was in first grade. (from Vol. 55) !~ [Also, Kaito Kid appears in his own manga series by Gosho Aoyama, 'Magic Kaito'.]
  성우: Kappei Yamaguchi

  이름: Heiji Hattori
  특징: Heiji is a high school detective, and the son of [Heizo Hattori,](https://anilist.co/character/30367/Heizo-Hattori) chief of the Osaka Police Department, and his wife [Shizuka Hattori.](https://anilist.co/character/41038/Shizuka-Hattori) Heiji wants to be a detective like his father since spending his childhood looking for lost cats in his neighborhood, and he is also very skilled in kendo and has become a favored tournament contender for his school. 

At one time during their childhood, Heiji had had the unfortunate idea of locking himself and his friend [Kazuha](https://anilist.co/character/3198/Kazuha-Toyama) together with a set of old handcuffs which had no key to unlock it; as a result they involuntarily had to spend time together even on some rather intimate occasions _(i.e., bathroom visits)_ before the cuffs could be removed. As a reminder of this 'closeness' and for good luck, Kazuha fashioned two identical lucky charms, each incorporating a chain link from the cuffs, which she and Heiji have been wearing ever since.

In the news, Heiji has been publicly declared the "Great Detective of the West", while [Shinichi Kudo](https://anilist.co/character/1742/Conan-Edogawa) is the "Great Detective of the East". As a result, Heiji showed up unannounced at the Mouri Detective Agency looking for Kudo, seeking to challenge his rival to a showdown of wits. _(In fact, they had such a contest before, three years previously, during a skiing trip in the Yamagata prefecture, although they never learned about each other's identities at that time.)_ Heiji was soundly defeated in the following case after Conan Edogawa temporarily turned back into Shinichi, but he gained a lot of respect for Shinichi in the process.

During their second encounter, Conan knocked Heiji out to use him as the mouthpiece for the voice-changing bow-tie. But during his final presentation of the facts, Heiji awoke prematurely and discovered Conan's secret, and in the end managed to blackmail Conan into revealing all. Ever since that revelation, Heiji has been helping Conan in hiding his secret identity, though he constantly slips up by calling him "Kudo" in front of [Ran](https://anilist.co/character/1748/Ran-Mouri) and Kazuha. 

Heiji and Conan most often congenially team up to solve assorted cases. Heiji has also helped Conan investigate the Black Organization on several occasions, such as when the two investigated [Jodie Starling,](https://anilist.co/character/26754/Jodie-Starling) or when Heiji investigated [Eisuke Hondou](https://anilist.co/character/5351/Eisuke-Hondou) on his own and then told Conan his findings, but he never had a real direct confrontation with the primary antagonist. He has also helped cover for Conan during several of the brief instances where Conan regained his true adolescent age, and has even disguised himself as Shinichi on several occasions in order to protect his identity, even though he is not very good at it _(mostly owing to his distinctive Kansai dialect)._ When not working on a case, he regularly attempts to invite Conan to take in the sights and culinary delights of Osaka, which he considers more wholesome than Tokyo's.

  성우: Ryou Horikawa

  이름: Kazuha Tooyama
  특징: [Heiji Hattori](https://anilist.co/character/1745/Heiji-Hattori) and Kazuha Toyama grew up together and are easily each other's best friend and mutual love interest. They have gone at the same school since they were in pre-school. Neither of them have been shown to have other close friendships outside of their relationships with [Shinichi](https://anilist.co/character/1742/Conan-Edogawa) and [Ran,](https://anilist.co/character/1748/Ran-Mouri) though Heiji does have a rivalry with fellow kendo practitioner [Okita.](https://anilist.co/character/128448/Soushi-Okita) They often spend time together, and Kazuha typically comes along when Heiji visits the Mouri's or vice versa, and is usually getting caught up with Heiji in criminal investigations. Kazuha and Heiji both wear twin good-luck charms that Kazuha made with pieces of the handcuff chain that stuck them together temporarily as children. Kazuha and Heiji have both shown jealousy when the other appears interested in someone else, even though they're not officially in a romantic relationship. Although, all their Jr. High School and High School classmates have commented that they're a couple. Their parents have known each other before they were even born. Making their families close. 

At one time in their youth, Heiji had had the unfortunate idea of locking themselves together with a set of old handcuffs which had no key and could not be unlocked; as a result they had to involuntarily spend time together even on some rather intimate occasions _(i.e., bathroom visits_ before the cuffs could be removed. As a reminder of this 'closeness' and for good luck, Kazuha fashioned two identical lucky charms, each incorporating a chain link from the cuffs, which she and Heiji have been wearing ever since. At some later point, Kazuha added a picture of Heiji into her own charm pouch.

Kazuha has a hot temper and can be highly critical of people around her. She has been hinted to have a high level of intelligence, as she was able to deduce a dying message in an episode even more quickly than either Ran or Kogoro could _(albeit with slight help from Heiji)._ Moreover, she is highly confrontational, and unafraid of letting others know about her dislike, even showing no hesitation or concern in confronting Heiji in a men's restroom. This trait leads to frequent shouting matches with Heiji, but it also allowed her and Ran to forge a strong friendship despite the fact that Kazuha, believing that Ran was Heiji's new girlfriend, took an initial deep dislike to Ran out of jealousy. Affection and approval are apparently much harder for her to express, most significantly with regard to Heiji; she is perfectly aware of her feelings for him and, after a few initial attempts to deny it to Ran, openly discusses her love for Heiji with her. However, even when a good opening appears to discuss her feelings with him, she instead panics and does her best to pretend that she and Heiji are 'only friends'. Although she has tried and failed to confess to Heiji twice already, Kazuha is determined to make her feelings clear to him one day. 

She also has a marked belief in spirits, good-luck charms, and other superstitions. Right from her first experience, she displayed her belief in the importance of hers and Heiji's omamori, charms which Kazuha made to protect her and Heiji from harm. And indeed, during the case in which this is revealed, Heiji lent Conan his omamori, and the metal inside the charm stopped a knife blade that could have killed Conan. On subsequent cases, Kazuha is quick to attribute mysterious shadows and strange events to ghosts and other malignant spirits, which usually sends Ran into panic as well, though she herself does not possess a morbid fear of ghosts as much as Ran does.

-등장인물-
  이름: Ichigo Kurosaki
  특징: __Race:__ Human 
__Height:__ 181 cm (5'11")
__Zanpakuto:__ [Zangetsu](https://anilist.co/character/911/Zangetsu)
__Relatives:__ [Isshin Kurosaki](https://anilist.co/character/2553/Isshin-Kurosaki) (father), [Masaki Kurosaki](https://anilist.co/character/22849/Masaki-Kurosaki) (mother, deceased), [Yuzu Kurosaki](https://anilist.co/character/1096/Yuzu-Kurosaki) and [Karin Kurosaki](https://anilist.co/character/4018/Karin-Kurosaki) (younger sisters)  

Ichigo Kurosaki is an orange haired teenager who lives in Karakura Town, being a capable student at his High School. But, more importantly, he's a Substitute Soul Reaper.

Ever since he was young, Ichigo has been able to see spirits, to the point where he could not tell the living from the dead. Due to this oddity, he would end up meeting [Rukia Kuchiki](https://anilist.co/character/6/Rukia-Kuchiki), a Soul Reaper. Soon after, once a hollow appeared and threatened his family, he recklessly fought back against it, forcing Rukia to save him by taking the blow of it's attack. Seeing Ichigo's determination to protect his family, Rukia offers to temporarily turn him into a Soul Reaper by piercing his chest with her Zanpakutō and transferring half of her power to him. Ichigo goes through with it, allowing him to make short work of the Hollow, and forcing him to fulfill Rukia's role as a Soul Reaper until she can regain her powers.

Being stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive, Ichigo often claims not to care about what other people think about him, and attempts to maintain a detached and "cool" image. He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together. His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and he tends to go into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major fight or lets a friend down. Despite what he lets on, he is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, and doesn't mind helping others when they become upset, or need the support. He is always willing to fight to protect those he cares for, no matter what it is he would be fighting against.
  성우: Masakazu Morita

  이름: Orihime Inoue
  특징: __Height:__ 157 cm (5'2")

Orihime Inoue is a teenage girl who lives by herself in Karakura Town, being a close friend of [Ichigo Kurosaki](https://anilist.co/character/5/Ichigo-Kurosaki). 

Orihime is alot of things, being friendly, kind, sensitive, and humorous in her own way. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Although, apparently she is hopeless when it comes to technology. She is also notorious for cooking up and eating strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes. Orihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences, plus she has an overactive imagination and can get carried away thinking of implausible scenarios. Orihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki, who she is deeply in love with. 

Previously, she had lived with her older brother, [Sora](https://anilist.co/character/27739/Sora-Inoue), who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive. When Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met [Tatsuki Arisawa](https://anilist.co/character/1094/Tatsuki-Arisawa) who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since.
  성우: Yuki Matsuoka

  이름: Yasutora Sado
  특징: __Height:__ 197 cm (6'5")  

Yasutora Sado, or as his friends call him, Chad, is a teenager of Mexican descent who is close friends with [Ichigo Kurosaki](https://anilist.co/character/5/Ichigo-Kurosaki). He is extremely tall and appears to be much older than he actually is.

Chad is a quiet person and is sometimes the subject of jokes or bullies because he never fights back, against ordinary humans, or often hollows and Soul Reapers until necessary. Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. To match his extraordinary size, Chad possesses extraordinary superhuman durability, even before activating his spiritual powers, being able to survive the impact of a falling steel girder on his back and a head-on motorcycle collision, and is strong enough to break telephone poles and wield them as giant clubs, even when already injured. Besides his physical strength, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 10th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo ranked 23rd.
  성우: Hiroki Yasumoto

  이름: Uryuu Ishida
  특징: __Species:__ Human (Quincy)  
__Height:__ 171 cm (5'7") - 177 cm (5'9")
__Spirit Weapon:__ Heilig Bogen
__Relatives:__ [Ryuuken Ishida](https://anilist.co/character/1083/Ryuuken-Ishida) (father), [Souken Ishida](https://anilist.co/character/22844/Souken-Ishida) (Grandfather, deceased) [Kanae Katagiri](https://anilist.co/character/85235/Kanae-Katagiri) (Mother, deceased)

Uryuu is a friend of [Ichigo Kurosaki](https://anilist.co/character/5/Ichigo-Kurosaki) and one of the last surviving Quincy. Uryuu is generally shy and quiet, but tries harder to act cool when other people are around. In addition, he also has a tendency to say things with characteristic drama. Uryuu operates on a moral ethic known as the "Pride of the Quincy" and has a strong sense of justice. He has also shown to be very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly. Uryuu also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so. Instead, he will simply incapacitate his opponent.  Uryuu does not hold his father, Ryuuken Ishida, in high respect; he calls his father by his given name which is considered very rude in Japanese society

His favorite food is homemade mackerel miso stew. The television program he likes is Don Kanonji's "Bura-Rei."
  성우: Noriaki Sugiyama

  이름: Yoruichi Shihouin
  특징: __Height:__ 156 cm (5'1")
__Previous Position:__ ~!22nd Head of Shihōin Clan, Captain of the 2nd Division, Onmitsukidō Commander-in-Chief, Corrections Corps Commander, Executive Militia Corps Commander!~
__Partner:__ [Kisuke Urahara](https://anilist.co/character/210)

Yoruichi Shihouin is an attractive, dark-skinned woman who can transform into a black cat for long periods of time. She is intelligent and witty, and is intimately knowledgeable of Soul Society and its workings, as she was the former leader of the special forces. Although of noble birth, she acts differently from other nobles. For instance, she instructed Soifon to refer to her without using honorific suffixes. She also transforms into her human form directly in front of Ichigo on several occasions just to see his reaction to seeing her naked.  

Yoruichi tends to avoid battles, preferring to help after a fight is over, but she will step in if she thinks her side cannot win. She was responsible for training Chad and Orihime prior to their entrance into Soul Society. She also supervised Ichigo Kurosaki's final release training using the methods developed by Kisuke Urahara.

줄거리: Business is slow for the Ootsuji Detective Agency. Sotaro and his juvenile sidekick Saki will take any job that comes along, even one that sounds like a lot more risk than it’s worth. It’s festival season in the city but away from the public eye, a wave of mysterious disappearances has occurred. A newspaperman hires Sotaro to investigate, suggesting that answers might lie somewhere in the Dark, the notorious, anarchic maze that is the city’s physical, social, and moral underground. Sotaro subcontracts the gig to Saki, but soon enough regrets it when the kid also goes missing. Now Sotaro is obligated to venture into the Dark himself, and confront its dubious subterranean denizens, including the malicious Laughing Masks gang and the renegade police squad piloting the fearsome Demon 463 armoured train!

  이름: Vegeta
  특징: __Race:__ Saiyan

Vegeta is a character from the manga series Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama.  

Aside from Goku, Gohan and Piccolo, he is easily one of the most prominent characters in the series, receiving more character development after being introduced than a number of other characters.  Vegeta is haughty, arrogant, and filled with hatred and bitterness as a result of the destruction of his home planet and his race's abusive treatment at the hands of Freeza. His royal status seems to have caused him to develop an inflated sense of superiority and he holds himself above most people he encounters.  In  _Cross Epoch_ (the  _Dragon Ball_ and  _One Piece_ crossover one-shot) Vegeta is the captain of an air ship and is seen wearing an eye patch and a cape with a clasp featuring the Kanji character for "vegetable." Trunks, Usopp, and Nico Robin are members of his crew.

During this journey they meet and befriend Yamcha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's _Journey to the West_. Gokuu also encounters one his closest friends, Kuririn, and others during his time training. Participating in several World Martials Arts Tournaments, ~!Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Piccolo Junior.!~

~!
_Dragon Ball Z_ takes place 5 years after the defeat of King Piccolo and Gokuu's last world tournament. We come to find out that Son Gokuu was originally named Kakarot, and is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu was sent from his home, planet Vegeta, to prepare Earth for sale on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life but due to that injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu forgot his purpose, and instead started focusing on becoming stronger for a little more than the pleasure of it. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who is some what of a cry baby but has hidden potential. Throughout the series, Gokuu faces terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, Intergalactic Rulers, Androids, and Extraterrestrial Beings that give him fights like no other. Along with new enemies, Gokuu also gains new friends that help him in these situations.  

In  _Dragon Ball GT_, which was not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by a wish on the dragon balls by Pilaf. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter, Pan, and Trunks. The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning one hundred years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.  

In  _Dragon Ball Online_ (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, and unlike Dragon Ball GT, Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.  In  _Cross Epoch_, the  _Dragon Ball_ and  _One Piece_ crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.!~

~!
In the Universe Survival Arc in Dragon Ball Super:
Using Ultra Instinct, he won against Kefla. 
He, along with Frieza, won the fight against Jiren (Universe 11) in the Tournament of Power, while sacrificing themselves, while he has the desire to fight Jiren again some time.!~

  성우: Masako Nozawa

  이름: Jinzouningen 18-gou
  특징: Android 18 is a fictional character who first appears in the Dragon Ball manga created by Akira Toriyama, followed by Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT. No. 18 is a mass murderer in Future Trunks' timeline.  A cybernetic human, #18 modified by Dr. Gero. She is often referred to in the original Japanese as a jinzōningen, which literally translates as "artificial human". She is not entirely an android; she refers to both herself and her twin brother as having been "constructed from a human base".   ~!After Cell is defeated, Kuririn uses the Dragon Balls to wish for #17 and #18 to be turned into humans; Shenlong is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed. Kuririn pursues #18 and, at some point, they marry and have a daughter named Marron.  To clear up the heavily espoused misconception that #18 is a pure android and therefore could not have a child, Kuririn went on to explain to Son Goku during the World Tournament Saga that she was originally human but that Dr. Gero just "remodeled her a little bit."!~

  성우: 

  이름: Mister Satan
  특징: His name in the original Japanese version media is Mister Satan. It was changed to Hercule in FUNimation's English dub and Viz Media English version of the manga. In the U.S. edition of Shonen Jump it is explained that Hercule is the real name of the character while Mr. Satan was his stage name though no such explanation was present in the original. He is voiced by Daisuke Gouri in the original Japanese version, Chris Rager in the FUNimation version and by Don Brown in the English version from the UK and Canada.   ~!Even though he has never directly saved the world he is highly responsible for defeating Kid Buu as he convinced everyone on earth to give power to Goku's Genki Dama, along with his direct role in defeating Majin Buu. A common point of humor after his first appearance in the Cell Saga is his extremely inflated ego, arrogance and craving for the spotlight which the Z Fighters find annoying at best. Interestingly enough, he never lost any World Tournament that he attended in the series, nor has he died, making him one of the few characters not to have done so along with Pan, his granddaughter. He has a daughter named Videl who dates/marries Son Gohan. A reference to this is made in the video games Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2 and Budokai Tenkaichi 3. If the player matches Adult Son Gohan and Mr. Satan the opening dialogue starts with Mr. Satan saying "If you want to go out with my daughter, you'll have to go through me!" Gohan replies, "Wait, it's not like that!" The fight then begins.!~  Source: Wikipedia
  성우: Tooru Sakurai

  이름: Pu'ar
  특징: Pu'ar is a soft-spoken shapechanging blue creature and the constant companion of Yamcha. The name is revealed to be a pun on Pu-erh tea. Pu'ar is neither a cat or a mouse, albeit the series creator Akira Toriyama stated that he had drawn the character to look a little bit like a cat. Traveling alongside Yamcha, the two worked as a team robbing anyone traveling through the desert area in which they lived. Pu'ar has an innate ability of levitation or flight, and is nearly always seen simply 'standing' in thin air at about human head height.  Pu'ar has the unique ability to shapeshift into any form, even inanimate objects, and can hold that form for as long as desired; his strength is not increased by the change, however, and as such he is unable to turn into something that can be used up like fuel or food. Pu'ar graduated from the same shapeshifting academy as Oolong, although unlike Oolong, Pu'ar had completed all of the academy training and does not have Oolong's difficulties with maintaining a transformed state. Pu'ar shows up quite a bit in the beginning, but becomes less of a presence as the series continues. As the driving theme of the series is mostly about fighting, Pu'ar can do little more than react to the horrors of the latest supervillains in the story.  There is some debate regarding the character's gender. Despite being portrayed by several female voice actors, the character has been referred to with both male and female pronouns during the anime. Though the issue of gender is never directly addressed, Toriyama has referred to Pu'ar as "he" while answering a fan question in the "Ask Me Anything" section in the back of the manga. Some fans believe that since shape-shifters can assume many different forms, gender is a moot point.

Bell Cranel is the captain of the Hestia Familia. Bell was raised by his grandfather in a rural farming village deep within the mountains near the labyrinth city Orario. He had heard and read many stories about heroes from his grandfather, forming his dream of aspiring to be a mighty one himself. After his grandfather's death, he took it upon himself to leave the village, traveling to the land of Orario to fulfill his dreams. Upon his arrival in the city, Bell attempted to enter numerous Familia, but was rejected by each one. Hestia, a Goddess, unable to find members willing to join her Familia, asked him if he'd like to become the first member of her Familia. Bell gladly accepted, and so started his new life, finally with a Goddess' blessing.

Bell is a kind, straightforward, brave, yet shy boy who desires to be a hero like the ones he grew up reading about. He cares deeply for the people around him, especially his Goddess, Hestia, and his Familia. He considers them like family due to the death of his grandfather. Bell's goals didn't start out pure, as he wanted to be an adventurer in hopes of picking up girls, even thinking of starting a harem. However, after his experience with Ais and Bete, Bell seems to have forgone that dream and fell in love with Ais Wallenstein. He became determined to grow stronger so that he could be someone that could stand beside her. Ais saved Bell in an incident with a minotaur and that event made Bell fall in love with her and have fear of Minotaurs. 

Bell is often scolded by people around him for his trusting nature. He was tricked out of his money by Naaza and Lili multiple times before he found out. In the latter's case, Hestia warned him that she may be untrustworthy; nevertheless, he still refused to abandon her. However, being the type to not hold grudges, he easily forgave both of them. When a body was discovered in the eighteenth floor and Ryuu was thought to be the murderer, he continually held doubts (despite mounting evidence seemingly pointing to her) and wanted to believe in her. Bell is also a terrible liar. His inability to lie or keep a secret is often easily recognized by others. It has been noted by Hestia that Bell has an extraordinary ability to read people. He recognized the loneliness in Lili to be similar to what he felt and was able to pick up on Lyd's feelings through his facial expressions fairly quickly. Though he gets flustered quite easily from time to time, especially around women, and can appear to be timid, Bell does possess a strong will. His feelings for Ais were strong enough to grant him a skill that highly accelerated his growth. His desire to be strong and stand next to her gave him the resolve to overcome his fear of Minotaurs and defeat one while still only a Level 1. He unknowingly went against Hermes's divine will and refused to kill Gros, choosing instead to believe in the dream of the Xenos and risk death. When he sets his mind to a goal, he puts his all towards completing it. He is the only adventurer to endure Eina's strict lessons, and he persisted through Ais's and Tiona's harsh training in preparation for the War Game against the Apollo Familia.

Bell often acts based on his feelings, causing him to be caught up in trouble, such as when he decided to help Lili, rescue Haruhime, and protect Wiene. However, such actions have also worked in his favor. His actions caused him to earn the affection of the aforementioned women, as well as several others. He saved Mord Latro, who had kidnapped Hestia and attacked Bell, from monsters, turning him from an enemy into an ally. His staunch support of the Xenos and his belief that they are worthy of being saved has made him extremely popular with them. His encounter with the Xenos deeply troubled him for a time. He was unsure if he could keep killing monsters, knowing that there were some that had the emotions and intelligence of people. With some advice from Fels, he decided to become a hypocrite: he would keep taking lives so that he could get stronger and protect others. Following his loss against Asterius and ascension to Level 4, Bell has become more calm and level-headed. Due to his goals now including creating a world that both people and Xenos could live in and defeating Asterius, his desire to be stronger has grown and he approaches adventures in the dungeon with more seriousness.

Hestia is an energetic, kind goddess who sees potential in Bell. She is a hard worker, and works jobs to support the two while Bell goes off to the dungeon. Hestia tends to be shown as very petty and gets jealous easily when girls, namely Aiz, show interest in Bell, because she is deeply in love with him, or they are the reason for his strength growth. Despite seeming mature and dependable toward Bell, Hestia is in truth, a lazy goddess, as she couldn't get a job or put effort into work. After descending to the Lower World, Hestia was taken care of by her friend Hephaestus. Soon after, she was asked to live on her own after she kept freeloading off of Hephaestus' familia and was given a room at an abandoned church. Hestia tried to create her own familia, but wasn't able to recruit anyone. After failing to recruit for the 50th time, she noticed Bell and decided to secretly follow him. Hestia found out that Bell had been trying to enter a familia, but was rejected multiple times and seemed to be in the same boat. Hestia then took the chance to recruit him, which Bell happily agreed upon; becoming the first member of her familia. She took Bell to a bookstore, the location she already decided beforehand, and granted her Falna to her first dependent.

She has just been dumped by her boyfriend, the president of a venture company, and kicked out of her house. She used SNS (Instagram-like) to appeal her flashy lifestyle too much. She didn't tell anyone that she was dumped, and she still continues to disguise her flamboyant life on social media. She is still heartbroken because she was dumped by her boyfriend, who said, "You have no substance and don't care about the people around you".

-등장인물-
  이름: Shinnosuke Nohara
  특징: He is a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. His affectionate name is Shin-chan. He is 5 years old and loves Chocobis and an animated superhero named "Action Kamen". He is attracted to older girls and women, despite his young age. He brazenly pursues any girl who catches his eye. He shares this trait with his father and paternal grandfather, but this often results in Mom's cruel punishment. The only girl he seems to really like is a college student named Nanako. Some of his strange activities include dressing up and mooning. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at various activities including kendo. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness (for example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, getting all wet and dirty and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes), but these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. There are also times when Shin Chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others. For example, during the trip to Australia where he bumps into Kazama, he kindheartedly arranged for Kazama's father to play ball with his son after Shin Chan notices him being sad on the beach.
  성우: 

  이름: Shiro
  특징: A white, fluffy puppy Shin-chan found in a cardboard box early in the series. While a beloved member of the family, he is the subject of neglect thanks to his owner's forgetfulness and short attention span. He is a very intelligent dog, often presenting logic and intellect that surpasses his human owners. As his meals from the Noharas are at best inconsistent, he has developed a talent for foraging. An oddly human-like dog, he is very responsible and painstakingly careful.  (Source: Wikipedia)
  성우: 

  이름: Misae Nohara
  특징: The mother of the Nohara family. She is 29 years old and a typical housewife of post-war Japan, she cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers, and lazes all to varying degrees of success. While at heart a caring and nurturing individual, her positive aspects are often offset by her many shortcomings. A paragon of hypocrisy, after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children, she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight. She administers brutal punishment to her husband, son, and on rare occasions her year-old daughter whenever they disobey her. While she spends as little as possible on the less-essential needs of her husband and son, she loves to splurge on Himawari and herself, though she is noted to have instances of great generosity. She is the source of boundless diet and savings plans, all of which fail within the first week. For example, she is prone to immediately partake in bargain sales when she sees them, thinking she is saving the family money. However, she buys in extreme quantities, which defeats the purpose. Additionally, she secretly hoardes money for her own personal use.  Source: Wikipedia
  성우: 

  이름: Masao Sato
  특징: Masao Sato is one of Shin-chan's friends. He is known to be a scaredy cat, and a bit of a cry baby. In the FUNimation dub, he is portrayed as having mildly effeminate/homosexual tendencies.
  성우: 

  이름: Nene Sakurada
  특징: Nene Sakurada is Shin-chan's female classmate and friend. She loves to play 'real omamagoto', or 'real house', in which divorces and arguments are very common. She occasionally sees her mother go crazy and shrieks something literally translated to be "You're not my usual mom!" She has the same character as her mother and she is often seen releasing her frustrations on a helpless stuffed bunny.

-등장인물-
  이름: Kaoru Kamiya
  특징: __Height:__ 155cm 
__Affiliations:__ Kamiya dojo

The primary instructor of the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryū fighting style developed by her late father, Kamiya Koshijirō, Kaoru inherited a small dojo from her father after he was killed during the Seinan War and operates it by herself. Naturally, she is independent, possessive, compassionate, courageous, feisty, strong-willed, and a great fighter to boot- with only the occasional mood swing. Kaoru is also known for her cooking disliked by her friends and family and her ability to see the good in others.
  성우: Rie Takahashi

  이름: Sanosuke Sagara
  특징: Sagara Sanosuke left home at an early age to join the Sekihō Army (Sekihō-tai), leaving behind his father (Kamishimoemon), his mother (Naname), and his younger sister (Uki) who adored him. He would return home years later to discover that his mother was dead, having died a couple of years after the birth of his younger brother, Ota, who immediately began to admire Sanosuke for his bravery and boldness. Sanosuke would also find out that his family name was now Higashidani, although he would never use it himself. His sister, after Sanosuke's disappearance and then her mother's death, became overprotective of her younger brother and father, who worked as a local merchant and farmer with the infamy of being a local fighter. Ota, after Sanosuke leaves his family again, would eventually follow his brother's advice and train at the Kamiya Kasshin-Ryū style dojo to become strong. The Sekihoutai fought for the imperial alliance at the end of the Tokugawa regime and Sanosuke admired his captain, Sagara Sōzō and took the family name Sagara from him. The Sekihō Army were on assignment to spread word of the halving of taxes proclaimed by the revolution. However, when the revolutionary government encountered financial problems, they labeled the Sekihoutai as frauds to bury their promises. This setup was engineered by Shindō Tatewaki, a former officer in the imperial alliance. The Sekihoutai were designated scapegoats and to be executed; Sanosuke was the only survivor, other than his friend Tsukioka Katsuhiro. The exact circumstances of Sōzō's death differ between the animated version and the manga; in the manga Sanosuke realized he had been killed after seeing his decapitated head on display as a warning, while in the anime a wounded Sōzō pushed Sanosuke to safety off a cliff in order to save him before dying himself. Full of anger and bitterness, Sanosuke made a living as a fighter-for-hire who bore the nickname "Zanza" derived from his weapon, the zanbatō. Sanosuke's sword, the heaviest katana ever made in the Rurouni Kenshin universe, originates from the Ōnin Struggle. Due to wear the blade no longer has an edge. Sanosuke uses the sword to smash and crush. Hiruma Kihei and Gohei hire Sanosuke to kill Himura Kenshin, but after the former assassin defeats Sanosuke and Sanosuke learns of the truth of Kenshin's no-kill approach, Sanosuke becomes a valuable ally. He later adopts a boxing-like fighting skill, known for the strength of his right fist. Because the zanbatō broke during the fight, Sanosuke no longer wields it on a regular basis, using only one more time in the manga to defend the Kamiya dojo during the Jinchu arc. At the end of the manga series, Sanosuke leaves Japan to avoid becoming wrongfully arrested and travels the world. He is not heard from until five years later during a reunion of the Kenshin-gumi, in which he tells them via a letter that he is in Mongolia and will stay there for a while before heading back to Japan.

  성우: Taku Yashiro

  이름: Kenshin Himura
  특징: __Height:__ 158cm  

Kenshin Himura, also known throughout the anime as Hitokiri Battousai (Battousai the Manslayer) or Himura the Battousai, is the main character of the series Rurouni Kenshin. His original name was Shinta (心太). 

His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon. Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and where about to kill him when Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning "Heart of Sword," took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.   

~! However, before full completion of the sword style could be passed on to Kenshin, the Japanese Revolution had been happening at the time and right before Kenshin's eyes.  Because of his kind nature and seeing people suffering, he knew he needed to do something about it.  He left in the middle of his training and without his master's blessing and joined the Imperialists.  It was during the Revolution where Kenshin met Tomoe, his first love and wife. During the revolution, Kenshin was given the nickname of Hitokiri Battousai because of his god-like speed of drawing a sword to kill the enemy instantly. After helping the Imperialist to a position where they would undoubtedly win the revolution, Kenshin left the revolution all-together with a vow to never kill again and the reverse-blade sword handed to him by Shakku-dono. It was Tomoe's death by his hands that pushed him over the edge of never to kill again.!~

The next time we see Kenshin is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes. Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again. It is here where he meets Kaoru Kamiya and his whole life begins to change once again.

Kenshin is usually depicted as a care-free swordsman who is very aloof and tends to be a bit simple-minded when it comes to living normally. He is seen to be doing many of the chores around the dojo that he stays at with Kaoru, (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc.). He believes it is his way of repaying Kaoru with allowing him to stay at her dojo. (although it seems he has gotten attracted to kaoru in the end). However, his swordsmanship ranks among the elite as he is seen defeating every rival (with the exception of Hajime Saitou which ended in a draw). His battle senses are top-notch and he recognizes even the slightest of advantages, strategies and tactics during a sword battle.

  성우: Souma Saitou

  이름: Makoto Shishio
  특징: After the death of Yukishiro Tomoe, Himura Kenshin became a free wielding swordsman to protect members of the Ishin Shishi. Shishio Makoto became his successor as the shadow hitokiri (assassin) and was responsible for the assassination of Izuka, the man who had betrayed the shishi.  

The future Meiji government was more secretive about Shishio than Kenshin; many members of the Chōshū and Satsuma clans (the members of the future Meiji government) would have very little information on him.  Later, the new Meiji government believed it would be in their best interests to eliminate Shishio before he became too powerful since Shishio was a man who desired power. Thus during the Boshin War, Shishio was rendered unconscious by several gunshots, doused in oil and burned alive by the new government formed by the Ishin Shishi. He survived, sustaining severe damage to his entire body. Afterwards, he assembled a group of the best fighters in Japan, called the Juppongatana (Ten Swords), to overthrow the Meiji government.  

Shishio envisioned a Japan ruled by him, enforcing the principles of natural selection, or what he called &quot;the strong eat the weak&quot;. Using this belief he ran a campaign against the Meiji government, as he felt it was too weak to effectively lead the country. Using his motto, he molded an ideological disciple out of Seta Sōjirō, who served as his right-hand man, and the strongest of the Juppongatana. He planned to strengthen the economy with petroleum once he took over the country.
  성우: Makoto Furukawa

  이름: Soujirou Seta
  특징: __PERSONALITY:__  Seta Soujiro is Shishio Makoto's right-hand man, a teenage assassin trained by Shishio himself. Soujiro is known for his lack of kenki or, simply, emotion. He possesses no anger and cites no fear in his enemies, other than with his sword. Soujiro is often seen smiling and has polite manners, always referring to others with Japanese suffixes. He is sarcastic, hiding his true emotions behind his smiling face. He however does have a special relationship with Yumi, she being a sister figure towards him. Soujiro usually dresses up in a blue kimono with white handguards.
__BACKGROUND:__~!Soujiro's constantly smiling face and polite manners stem from his tragic past. Born in Kanagawa Prefecture during the first year of Bunkyū (1861), Soujiro is an illegitimate child. Sōujiro's father left him in the care of his family, who badly mistreated him. He is assigned chores such as carrying rice to and from the family warehouse, and whenever he faltered, he was beaten by his family. Soujiro built a defense against their lashings; he put on a smiling face and endured the torture until they got tired of beating him and left him alone.  One night, he meets Shishio, who was on the run from the police. Soujiro witnesses Shishio kill some police officers and Shishio is about to kill him for it until he notices Soujiro smiling and therefore spares him in exchange for food and bandages. Shishio tells Soujiro that only the strong may live and that his predicament is his own fault for being weak. This new mentality, and a sword given to him by Shishio, determine his defense when his family finds him housing Shishio. Sojiro quickly finds himself cornered by them, attempting to murder him and blame his death on Shishio, and lashes out, killing every one of them at the age of eight.!~  
__TECHNIQUES:__ ~! Soujiro''s apparent lack of emotion, his simple, insensitive mentality that the strong will live and the weak shall die, and his skills make him a formidable foe for Kenshin. As a master swordsman of his own style, Soujirou's abilities have earned him the nickname of "Heaven's Sword" (天剣, Tenken?, Ten meaning Heaven and Ken meaning Sword, "Tenken" means swordsmanship of natural endowments). His shukuchi utilizes such powerful speed that, to an observer, it appears that the distance between the two fighters has shrunk (hence the name shukuchi, which means "reduced earth").  During his fight with Kenshin, Soujiro continually states he's only moving "three steps below shukuchi" or "two steps below shukuchi." While moving at the speed his shukuchi utilizes, the only thing that can be seen is Soujiro's footsteps ripping through the tatami mats. During "one step below shukuchi", he is able to attack from an omnidirectional angle, utilizing not only horizontal but vertical space.[5] While performing true shukuchi, he completely disappears and cannot be seen, even by Kenshin. Soujirou can dodge the Kuzu-ryūsen (九頭龍閃?, lit. "Nine-headed Dragon Flash"),[6] a move which apparently cannot be evaded even by Kenshin himself. Soujirou is also the first one ever to slash Kenshin in the back in the series.  Soujiro is also well versed in the Battōjutsu style like Kenshin, as is evident when he decides to use a stance similar to Kenshin's and when he destroys Kenshin's first sakabatō. Combining the true speed of shukuchi with the Battōjutsu, he has created his only named technique, Shuntensatsu (瞬天殺?, lit. "Instant Heaven Kill"), meaning "immediate killing by heaven's sword". It is named this because the speed behind the attack is so swift that the opponent dies instantly before falling to the floor.!~

  이름: Currypanman
  특징: Another of Anpanman&#039;s friends. His head is made from Curry (curry filled bread in Japanese anime). He is quick tempered and hot-headed on the surface, but gives way to a kind and sentimental interior. He likes hot food and dislikes sweet food. Tends to be the strongman of the trio. Wields the Curry-punch and Curry-kick, which are similar to Anpanman&#039;s fighting techniques.

  성우: Miina Tominaga

He and Anpanman were born at the same time, making them physical representations of moral dualism. He has a weakness to soap, which shrinks him to the size of a fly.

-등장인물-
  이름: Mikan Tachibana
  특징: A 17-year old high school student, and is the intended &quot;main protagonist&quot; of the series. (The &quot;atashi&quot; (me) in the title.) She goes to school in a public high school, which unfortunately is a long, stressful commute away. She is portrayed as an easy-going, relaxed girl who likes to have fun. Often very maiden-like, but other times very tomboyish, she goes through every day with some funny thing happening.  Her best friends in high school consist of the &quot;adult&quot;-like Shimi-chan (her last name Shimizu), who always stays calm and collected, and always has good advice from diets to dealing with parents; and Yukarin (her first name Yuka), who loves karaoke and introduces Mikan to the &quot;cuter&quot; things in life.  Mikan has a crush on the bishōnen-type Iwaki. Although she wants to confess her feelings to him, she is often foiled by his best friend, Yoshioka, whose wisecracks get under Mikan&#039;s skin.  What&#039;s worse is that Mikan and Yoshioka have attended the same academies since Elementary School, and people (including her own Mother) persuade her to date Yoshioka. At times, when she looks in the direction of Iwaki and Yoshioka, Shimi-chan gets the wrong idea and assumes Mikan is staring at Yoshioka, not Iwaki.  She &quot;gets-by&quot; in school, is horrible at taking notes, and is a heavy sleeper, which unfortunately makes her late to school. She also has a habit of falling asleep through homework assignments, causing her to have no choice but to submit incomplete assignments.  Her interests include karaoke, eating sweets (although she dislikes chocolate cake), and admiring/creating teddy bears.  She is part of her high school&#039;s &quot;Bear Brigade&quot; (composed of the wealthy, fashionable Rio; the geeky-yet-romantically-involved Nitta; and best friends Kajii and Asada), who create original teddy bears, perform teddy bear acts, and admire expensive teddy bear toys.  Her goal in life is to become a famous teddy bear and/or fashion designer. According to her mother, she taught herself how to sew on buttons (through observation) at the age of 3. She once fancied being a breadmaker, but lost interest soon after.  She is often bogged down by her Mother&#039;s rules, which inhibit her allowance, her fashions, her curfew, and mostly&mdash;her simple boxed lunches. She is frustrated that her Mother lets her younger brother get away with some rules, however, she often (and cleverly) makes her case.
  성우: Fumiko Orikasa

  이름: Midori Imaji
  특징: A modern-day Japanese housewife, who prides herself on a clean home, a balanced budget, and a frugal yet &quot;tasty&quot; dinner. Although at times she finds nifty tricks to multitask and consolidate household chores (like vacuuming the rug and waxing the wooden floor all at once), she is awfully clumsy and gets herself into sticky situations from losing control. Despite her hard work, she is also known for being somewhat lazy by taking copious afternoon naps, watching TV while eating senbei, and skimping out on shopping and/or cooking on rainy days.  She often steps out on shopping trips and afternoon teas with her good friends Mrs. Mizushima and Mrs. Toyama. Additionally, they often take part in activities with (the more affluent) Mrs. Misumi. They often envy Mrs. Misumi&#039;s &quot;rich&quot; lifestyle and try to find &quot;affordable ways&quot; to be more stylish and upbeat.  Her hobbies include shodou and cooking and eating chikuwa.  She was also born in Ōita Prefecture. Her childhood name was &quot;Banban&quot;. Although she had a childhood friend (that she liked a lot and hoped to marry), she was placed into an Omiai arranged marriage and married Father.  She is also a very strict mother to her two children, and tries to have them waste less money/electricity/food, etc. Although she tries to make herself look more upbeat, she is very traditional in thinking when it comes to her daughter Mikan. (She won&#039;t allow pierced ears, staying out late for Karaoke, excessive fashions, and values housework over homework.) She is sweet on her younger son, however, and often lets him slide with things Mikan can&#039;t get away with.
  성우: Kumiko Watanabe

  이름: Yuzuhiko Tachibana
  특징: A second-year junior high school student who is very studious and forward-thinking. He is innovative and his brain far exceeds his age. He tends to find solutions to the family&#039;s (common) mishaps. Yuzuhiko is far more intelligent than Mikan.  He enjoys playing video games and listening to music. His secret pastime is admiring the fictional idol Marumi Maruno. He collects photos, magazines, and keepsakes related to her. However, he keeps this secret from his family (in fear of ridicule) and his friends (since they prefer other idols aside from Maruno).  He has a love for Mayonnaise, and is very picky about which brand his pennypinching mother buys.  Although he reveres in the fact that his Mother is sweet on him, he hates all the attention she gives him. He prefers to be treated more as an adult, and to not be called &quot;Yuu-chan&quot; anymore.  At school, he does well and gets very good marks, but is often intimidated by his teacher, Miss Hara.  He also has many friends, and is seen as one of the more popular students.  His best friend is Fujino, who shares his interests in books, music, and games. However, Fujino is seen as more of a boke to Yuzuhiko&#039;s tsukkomi, by acting very immature and childish. Fujino has a crush on Mikan, which disturbs Yuzuhiko. (He even goes as far as to tell Fujino about Mikan&#039;s &quot;disgusting&quot; traits, only to get caught and scolded loudly by Mikan.) His other friends include the timid Nasuo Arai, who at one point shared his love for Marumi Maruno, but then changed his mind; the popular girl Sudou, who makes friends with everyone; and the &quot;unique&quot; Yuri Ishida, whose appearance and weird quirks seem to repel the other classmates, yet attract the attention of Yuzuhiko, Fujino, and Sudou.  He also has a &quot;Fan Club&quot;, which was founded by Sayu Kawashima, who has a strong crush on Yuzuhiko. She comes up with many ways to convey her feelings to him, but those plans always get foiled, often by Yuri Ishida. He considers Ishida to be her &quot;rival&quot;, even though Ishida shows no interest in Yuzuhiko. At times, she gets into situations where Yuzuhiko &quot;saves&quot; her (by catching her when she falls, or bumps into him), which result in a lovestruck scurry. The other member of the &quot;Fan Club&quot; is her best friend, Yamashita. Yamashita is often the voice of reason or gives her the (much-needed) reality check that that calms Kawashima down.  In one note-worthy moment, after seeing Yuzuhiko&#039;s charicature drawing of Kawashima (which turned out terrible), Kawashima gave up her feelings for him, but after Yuzuhiko&#039;s apology and explanation that he intended the doodle to be &quot;cute&quot;, Kawashima regained her feelings.  Aside from his nickname, Yuzupii, the &quot;Fan Club&quot; refer to him by the code name &quot;Hibari-chan&quot; (Little Skylark). This comes from a mass string of word association. (Tachibana Yuzuhiko [his name]--&gt;Yuzu Miso [a citrus-based condiment]--&gt;Miso [bean paste]--&gt;Misora Hibari [enka singer]--&gt;Hibari [Skylark].

At the end of Nisemonogatari, she said goodbye to Koyomi, implying that she will not be seeing him again, which will be the basis of the next story, Mayoi Jiangshi.

While the first one is banished, Koyomi is forced to battle the second to keep it from killing Nadeko.!~ She's quite protective of her hair (particularly her forelocks) thinking that it's her place to guard more than her panties. When she finally combed her forelocks aside in Nisemonogatari, Koyomi commented that she has a glare just like a serpent, probably foreshadowing the story of Nadeko Medusa.

In Nademonogatari, ~!Nadeko gains a power to draw, create, and then materialize shikigami, making her useful in the eyes of [Izuko Gaen](https://anilist.co/character/87115/Izuko-Gaen) and gets offered a job, thanks to [Yotsugi Ononoki](https://anilist.co/character/57499/Yotsugi-Ononoki)!~

-등장인물-
  이름: Leo Tsukinaga
  특징: __Unit:__ Knights
__Club:__ Archery Club
__Circles:__ Dramatica, Overnight Outdoors

A popular composer who is showered in attention even from overseas. Leo is pure and unrestrained, but he cares deeply for his comrades and can sometimes be naive. His singing voice is as if it's playing and changes often, and his performances are overflowing with confidence.
A member of NEW DIMENSION’s Knights.

His eccentric and loud personality often confuses other people, as he doesn’t care about what is considered “childish” and indulges in any activity he might like, ultimately almost always acting on his own volition. Due to his free spirit, he even ends up skipping unit practice, causing Tsukasa to have to forcefully drag him to school.

Leo is a forgetful person, not remembering things he deems as unimportant and struggling to remember names as a whole. Although, despite his forgetful and seemingly clumsy personality, he is insightful and promptly knows when to give advice, as well as analytic and extremely aware about all details about the people he considers close, making him much more competent than he seems at first glance.
His personality underwent a deep change compared to his second year self, as he is not as naive and childish as before, and is now much harsher in his approaches. However, things such as his kindness remained as he is always wanting to help someone out, even if by questionable means. Leo still believes that holding grudges is a waste of time, and trying to keep a positive outlook on relationships.

He is impulsive in nature, and there are many times when he does not think things through before speaking, and unintentionally hurts the other person due to his eccentricity and spontaneity, as well as does things on a whim with no plans beforehand whatsoever. He goes to great lengths for inspiration, and can start composing a new piece anywhere any time, this is a habit that gains him lectures by Keito, since he ends up scribbling on the school’s walls with crayons without permission.

He doesn’t shy away from using somewhat hurtful means to achieve certain results, purposefully creating conflict to rile people up being the most common of them. However, in his heart, Leo is a truly kind and caring person, who wishes nothing more than the best for his friends and family, although not always being able to demonstrate it in a proper manner.

  성우: Shintarou Asanuma

  이름: Ritsu Sakuma
  특징: __Unit:__ Knights
__Club:__ Tea Club
__Circles:__ FLAVOR, CRAFTMONSTER

In the daytime it's hard to get his engine going, so Ritsu is often found napping in all sorts of places. He goes at his own pace and is relaxed, but can say some cutting things when he thinks quickly. His singing voice is like a sweet whisper, and his performances flow languidly.
A member of NEW DIMENSION’s Knights.

Though he may seem cold and uninterested, Ritsu is a playful and intelligent person at his core. Energy isn't something that comes naturally to him, and he is instead quietly passionate, and likes to tease others, enjoying their reactions.

At the start of the year, Ritsu tended to distance himself from his classmates and idol activities, which he viewed as laborious and boring because of the previous fractured state of knights. He was reluctant to make friends due to this (Mao also insinuates he has social anxiety issues). But as the year goes on, Ritsu begins to open up and form important bonds with his friends and unitmates. He is very loyal and affectionate to the select few he is truly comfortable with.

Ritsu can be blunt and harsh to a fault, but is very intuitive and often picks up on others' emotions. He regards psychoanalysis as a 'bad habit' of his, yet is very adept at it. At times, he be very clingy, and loves it when others praise him. He can be violent, especially towards his older brother, and doesn't hold his tongue often. Despite this, he can get very protective of his loved ones, to the point of being possessive.

Ritsu has abandonment issues largely stemming from Rei's absence last year, which contributes to his tendency of clinging to those he truly loves, yet also his habit of distancing himself from others as a whole. He shares Rei's aversion of sunlight, and becomes more active and 'alive' at night. They also share a habit of jokingly regarding themselves as older and wiser than their juniors.

He loves music, and plays the piano. His songwriting reveals a much deeper and more wistful side of him, something that he almost never reveals to others, preferring his smug and sleepy persona. Somewhat surprisingly, though, he tends to keep things to himself to avoid burdening others. As it stands, Ritsu values his unit and friends very much, and is willing to put effort into his idol work (or at least that which interests him).
  성우: Daiki Yamashita

  이름: Izumi Sena
  특징: __Unit:__ Knights
__Club:__ Tennis Club
__Circles:__ Niki's Kitchen, OCEANS

On top of his idol activities, Izumi engages in modelling in Europe. Stoic and high-strung, he also enjoys fussing over people who give him the chance to do so. He has a soulful singing voice and his performances are relaxed and beautiful.

He has a rude attitude towards most people he meets, being overly harsh in his criticisms and quick to point out their flaws. Despite this, he is quick to lend a helping hand to anyone who needs it, although begrudgingly. He never seems to ignore the struggles of other people, especially his underclassmen, who he wants to guide and take care of despite his harsh and grumpy personality. His harshness is often interlaced with an overbearing fussiness and perfectionism that renders him unable to sit back and watch while others fail.

Contrary to his claims, Izumi treasures his unit to an unimaginable extent, always working hard to make up for his wrongdoings during DDD and pushing himself to be better.

  성우: Masami Itou

  이름: Arashi Narukami
  특징: __Unit:__ Knights
__Club:__ Track & Field Club
__Circles:__ Dramatica, Pretty 5

A self-proclaimed “big sister”. She is skilled at taking care of people and loves cute things. She has a friendly and sociable personality, but can occasionally have extreme mood swings. She has ample self-confidence when it comes to a refined performance and a light, gentle singing voice.
A member of NEW DIMENSION's Knights.

Arashi is a kind, determined individual with a playful streak. It is rare to see her raise her voice, and when she does, it is usually because someone she cares about is going through difficult times or is being mistreated. She has shown a fierce desire, time and time again, to protect everyone who is important to her, and this sometimes causes her to come off as overbearing or fussy despite also trying to be hands-off to keep the peace in some situations. She tries to solve her problems on her own without involving others even though she is often trying to help others herself, which can sometimes hurt her friends, as they may perceive her as being a stranger and not letting them know anything about her. Because she often refuses to accept help from others, when a situation becomes more stressful than she can handle, she may snap at those around her or push them even further away.

She is dedicated to the act of self-love, often declaring that she is the most beautiful and that no matter how others feel about her, she loves herself. This act may be used to cover her insecurities, but she wants those around her to see their strengths and love themselves as well. Though often seeming mature and capable, she possesses a childish side and loves competition, especially against fellow model Izumi. Due to how easily skills come to her, she adores people who work hard for what they have and always cheers on those around her in their endeavors. She has a sweet tooth and absolutely loves cake, but she tries not to eat too much of it due to worrying about its calorie content.

  성우: Ryou Kitamura

  이름: Tsukasa Suou
  특징: __Unit:__ Knights
__Club:__ Archery Club
__Circles:__ BIBLION, Sweets Fan Club, Kaori

The son of a noble family, Tsukasa acts with a chivalrous spirit as his core, so he's more composed than others his age. While he's responsible and serious, he can also be childish and short-tempered. His singing voice is honest and direct, and his performances are powerful yet elegant.
Tsukasa is the leader of NEW DIMENSION's Knights.


While his gentlemanly manner attracts the ladies, he seems to be unaware of this and doesn't know much about the female mind. He has interest in the culture of commoners. His English pronunciation is smooth, which unfortunately only makes it hard to catch.

  이름: Aizou Shibasaki
  특징: Aizo Shibasaki, also known by his stage name Aizo, is a character featured in Confession Executive Committee, a primary character of the Idol Series, and member of [LIP×LIP](https://anilist.co/staff/147796/LipxLip). He is a member of Class 1-4 and a student of Sakuragaoka High School during the secondary cast's second year of high school. He is the younger brother of [Ken Shibasaki](https://anilist.co/character/134007/Ken-Shibasaki).
Aizo is an sociable character, chatty and friendly to everyone he meets. Public reports of his idol persona label him as very amiable and popular to approach. However, he's more prone to being irritated, making others butt out of his business by snapping at them, being more visibly angry with Yujiro, and preferring to be left alone. His language is rougher in his off-stage persona as well to reflect this.
  성우: 

  이름: Yuujirou Someya
  특징: Yuujirou Someya, also known by his stage name Yuujirou, is a character in the Confession Executive Committee song series, a primary character in the Idol Series, and a member of [LIP×LIP](https://anilist.co/staff/147796/LipxLip). He is a Sakuragaoka High School student in Class 1-4 during the secondary cast's second high school year.

Yujiro is fairly short for his age, and has short, dark blue hair with bangs cut in a diagonal, asymmetrical fashion and a few hairs sticking up, and matching blue eyes. Before he became a part of LIP×LIP, he had a bob haircut that came down to his mid-neck, and his bangs were blunted. He eventually cuts them into their iconic asymmetry when he becomes a teenager. Yujiro takes pride in the bangs, and finds them a charm point. Yujiro, for his public appearances, is described as "refreshing, kind, and cool". When it comes to socializing, he is polite and friendly to whoever he talks to, making them feel at ease. His behind-the-scenes persona is a much different character; he appears to be aloof and a bit hard to read, and can get rather open about his displeasure with certain subjects

-등장인물-
  이름: Kirimaru Settsuno
  특징: __Class:__ 1st-year Ha-class
__Committee:__ Library
__Occupation:__ Student

Kirimaru is an orphan from an early age, and he doesn't have a surname. He is very street-wise and is always thinking of money and/or ways to get more. Doesn't take his studies as seriously as his part-time jobs, provoking his teachers' ire, but still likes being part of Ninjutsu Academy and being together with his friends. Currently lives with Hansuke Doi, his homeroom teacher.

He can be considered aloof at times, but takes his part-time jobs very seriously, oftentimes neglecting school work. His eyes turn into big gold coins whenever he hears the word "money", "treasure", "reward", "prize", etc. He is often looking for dropped coins on the road and loves to count his money whenever alone in his room which he shares with Rantarou and Shinbei. As shown whenever on errand jobs, he is good at handling kids, random pets, house chores and many other things. As a result of his stingy personality, he doesn't like being asked favors without compensation, but ends up doing them anyway.

Kirimaru has dark violet hair, with bangs parted down the middle and revealing a low widow's peak. He has hair tied into a tidy ponytail. Kirimaru has relatively sharp eyes, and has a unique charm point in his pointed tooth that appears when he is being mischievous.
  성우: Mayumi Tanaka

  이름: Rantarou Inadera
  특징: __Class:__ 1st-year Ha-class
__Committee:__ Health
__Occupation:__ Student 

Coming from a "common, nameless" ninja family, Rantarou is determined to become one of the best, elite ninjas. However, he often fools around with his two best friends Kirimaru and Shinbei and gets into trouble, often angering Doi-sensei and Yamada-sensei.

Rantarou has reddish, short and fluffy hair. He wears round glasses and has freckles on his cheek. In casual dress, he wears a green and light green spotted sleeves and blue-grey hakama.
  성우: Minami Takayama

  이름: Hansuke Doi
  특징: __Class:__ 1st-year Ha-class
__Committee:__ Explosives
__Occupation:__ Theory teacher, Advisor

A skilled and good-natured teacher, Doi is both strict and kind to his students. Despite his frequent stress-induced stomachaches caused by his class' poor academic standing, Doi remains persistent in trying to teach them, and believes in their practical abilities and individual talents. He is well-loved by his class, as well as the other nintama and staff of the Ninjutsu Academy. Outside of his job as a teacher, Doi works proficiently as a ninja. However, he is also shown frequently forgetting to pay his rent or attend town cleaning due to his busy life preparing make-up classes for the 1st-year Ha-class. He also shows a rather childish side when faced with his least favorite food.

Doi is of average build and height, with a slight baby-face. He has upturned eyes, a slightly pointed nose, and defined eyebrows. Notably, he has long, messy brown hair, but this is completely hidden when he wears his current ninja zukin or his casual hat, giving the illusion of short hair - usually, all that is visible is his characteristic bangs. In the past, this hair was tied in a messy ponytail.

~!Doi-sensei was brainwashed by Dokutake in the novel "Rakudai Ninja Rantarou: Dokutake Strongest Warrior," and had another persona known as Tenki. He eventually recovered his recollection and returned to his student. !~
  성우: Toshihiko Seki

  이름: Shinbei Fukutomi
  특징: __Class:__ 1st-year Ha-class
__Committee:__ Equipment
__Occupation:__ Student

Shinbei is relaxed, happy-go-lucky, and kind. He is a gourmand, and often hungry; he can easily be persuaded to act with the promise of food, similarly to how Kirimaru is driven by wealth. Shinbei is a lot slower than his friends in class and is supported often by Rantarou and Kirimaru, but he has occasional moments of brilliance where he says something smart or shows great physical strength.

The shortest of all the known nintama, Shinbei is stout and chubby; sometimes he is shown having an average physique when he is unwell. He has tidy, flowing hair tied into a short ponytail - his bangs are shown to be parted down the middle when he is not wearing his hood. He has super-thick eyebrows, dot-like eyes, and a wide mouth. When Shinbei runs out of hair conditioner, his hair turns incredibly hard and bristly, and stands on end (this also applies to his eyebrows on one occasion).

His casual wear consists of a periwinkle kimono with white polka dots and a wide red hakama that goes all the way down to his ankles (due to his short stature).

-등장인물-
  이름: Fuyuko Mayuzumi
  특징: **Height:** 163 cm
**Hometown:** Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan

Fuyuko is a kind girl with a modest smile. Fuyuko is first seen as a bubbly and cheerful girl that likes cute things and is attentive to her surroundings. However, her true personality is much more serious, and she acts in a cutesy manner because she believes others will like her more when she does. The tone of her voice also changes from cute to serious between these personalities. She gets nervous easily and loses her temper when stressed, but doesn't want people to worry about her insecurities.
  성우: Eri Yukimura

  이름: Toru Asakura
  특징: __Height:__ 160 cm

A girl who doesn't put on appearances. Not worrying about how others view her, she is calm and goes at her own pace. However, she has an aura that attracts everyone in her despite her overflowingly transparent appearance. She is in her 2nd year of high school.

She has a serious and honest personality, but she also is rather easygoing and follows her whims. She expresses her feelings differently than most people, and can become disheartened when she feels like she can't connect or communicate with others. Therefore, it's hard to tell what she's thinking most of the time.
  성우: Yuu Wakui

  이름: Asahi Serizawa
  특징: **Height:** 153 cm
**Hometown:** Tokyo

Asahi is a middle schooler who loves looking for fun in every aspect of the world. She has an endless amount of natural talent for most anything she tries, and her genuine and innocently unique personality makes her fearless in the world of becoming an idol, as long as she's having a fun time.

Constantly searching for intriguing things, she is a strong, inquisitively spirited girl who never stands still. However, she can be straightforward when interested in something but can be easily bored sometimes.
  성우: Yuki Tanaka

  이름: Mano Sakuragi
  특징: __Height:__ 155 cm
__Hometown:__ Tokyo, Japan
__Hobbies:__ Going out, Sun basking in the park

Mano is a gentle girl who you want to protect. Her catchphrases are “Howa~” and “Mun!”. Mano has a kind personality and rarely gets angry or gives her opinion without being asked, but she has a tendency to saddle herself with worries in secret... Raised close to nature since she was young, Mano loves spending her time relaxing in the park. When Mano visits the park birds tend to gather around her and she often loses track of time playing with them. Mano loves birds and has a pet pigeon named Pii-chan. Mano also loves shopping and going on excursions. However, Mano has a slight aversion to large crowds since she often gets pushed around. Social interaction isn't Mano’s strong suit, and she was scouted by Producer while she was wondering whether she’d be alright staying her shy self forever. While usually not the type to take initiative on her own, after being offered several times Mano came to think being an idol “could be a chance to change herself” and decided to become an idol. Mano is a part of the unit “illumination STARS”. She has great respect for her unit-mate [Hiori’s](https://anilist.co/character/136822/Hiori-Kazano) solemn devotion to lessons and idol work as well as her unit-mate [Meguru's](https://anilist.co/character/136821/Meguru-Hachimiya) ability to make friends with anyone.

A soft-spoken shy girl with a kind, genuine personality. Mano's gentle demeanor can soften even the most hardened heart due to her kindness towards everyone she meets.
  성우: Hitomi Sekine

  이름: Mei Izumi
  특징: **Height:** 162 cm
**Hometown:** Saitama

An upbeat girl with an optimistic and broad attitude. While she has a hard time understanding more complex things, she's still easy to talk to. She is in her 3rd year of High School.

Initially, despite being very energetic and friendly towards everyone she meets, when she gets on stage in front of an audience her voice becomes small and she struggles to get words out due to a past event. In order to help Mei work around her stage fright, the producer suggests that she adopt a cool and mysterious image as her on-stage persona. This way, she won't need to worry about talking a lot or forcing herself to make her voice sound bubbly. Mei agrees, and after her first performance she thanks the producer for her new strategy which allows her to continue to pursue a life as an idol. In stark contrast to how Mei acts in everyday life, laughing often and comfortably making conversation with even strangers, her on-stage personality is terse, speaking few words with a steady and husky voice.

-등장인물-
  이름: Gintoki Sakata
  특징: __Height:__ 177 cm  

A samurai living in an era where a samurai is no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade. Gintoki lives with Kagura and Shinpachi, taking on odd jobs to make the world a better place...and to pay their rent. In the Joi war, he was known as the "White Devil" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white coat he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear into Amanto. Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her. Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response back and merely puts up with them as annoyances.  Gin has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet foods such as parfait, ice cream, and cake. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published in). His favorite type of milk is strawberry milk. Gin will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him easily dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a "Bankai" similar to the hero characters of Bleach. Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old Bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he barely got acquainted too, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.   Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joi war.

~!During the Shogun Assassination Arc, Gintoki's past is fully revealed, Alongside Takasugi and Katsura, he was taught at Shoka Sonjuku by Yoshida Shoyou. However Shoyou gets captured by the Tenshouin Naraku for abandoning them when he was still known as Utsuro and much later down the line in the Joui War Gintoki is captured along with Katsura and Takasugi, He has a choice to kill his teacher or his two friends. If he kills his teacher, they will be released; if he kills his friends, his teacher will be released; if he does nothing, everyone dies. Faced with an impossible decision, and not wanting to lose anyone he makes the impossible decision and takes Yoshida Shoyou's head.!~
  성우: Tomokazu Sugita

  이름: Maizou Rotten
  특징: Servant of the Tokugawa Family.   ~!He is later revealed to be Suzuran's lover.!~
  성우: Shigeru Chiba

  이름: Kagura
  특징: __Height:__ 155 cm

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato is said to have "transparent" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise at her hands.  She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During a battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.  Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.  Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.  She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.  Kagura and Gintoki share an odd father-daughter-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them make for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although, she herself has gotten into many fights with him, rarely does she let anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come to save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits, and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with "Gin-chan says..." or "Gin-chan told me..."  Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, ​and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself is common behavior for Kagura.  She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him, and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that "he definitely likes me", but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.  According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.  In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh, nope, and the like.   ~!In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes.!~ In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in 6th place.
  성우: Rie Kugimiya

  이름: Suzuran
  특징: Being the highest ranking courtesan of Yoshiwara, she excels in singing and dancing and no one in Yoshiwara can rival her in any of the arts.
  성우: Teiyuu Ichiryuusai

  이름: Shinpachi Shimura
  특징: __Height:__ 166 cm

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the "Otsu's Imperial Guard," a pop singer's fan club.  Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.  Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordsmanship his dojo teaches.  In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.  His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura.

  이름: Noko Shikanoko
  특징: __Grade:__ 3rd Year
__Positions:__ Founder, Mascot, and Official Deer of the Deer Club, Part-Time Deer at Hino Zoo.

Noko Shikanoko is a unique human-deer hybrid and the founder and mascot of the Deer Club at Hino Minami High School.

She is a transfer student who becomes the best friend, classmate, and clubmate of [Torako Koshi](https://anilist.co/character/330137/Torako-Koshi).
  성우: Megumi Han

  이름: Torako Koshi

  성우: Saki Fujita

  이름: Anko Koshi
  특징: __Grade:__ 1st Year
__Position:__ "Self-Proclaimed Sister Caretaker" of the Deer Club

Anko is a new student at Hino Minami High School, the 3rd official member of the Deer Club, and the younger sister of [Torako Koshi](https://anilist.co/character/330137/Torako-Koshi). She is best known for her sister complex towards their older sibling; being highly obsessed with everything regarding her sister and making it her personal life goal to be always by her sister's side 24/7, much to the latter's dismay and embarrassment. She will not hesitate to try and outright assassinate anyone who goes as far as to even just stand within near proximity of Koshitan, typically having a dark and sinister aura whenever somebody starts to act all chummy with them. Anko is also known to be adept at arming herself with her collection of kunai when faced with possible "threats" and in setting traps in her victims' surroundings. 

The only time she has made an exception to anyone else getting close to her sister was when she tried killing [Noko Shikanoko](https://anilist.co/character/330136/Noko-Shikanoko), only to see, much to her surprise, that her sister deeply cares for Nokotan. Thus, she decided that someone else, for once, was also worthy of supporting Koshitan as well, just as long as it was together.
  성우: Rui Tanabe

  이름: Meme Bashame
  특징: __Grade:__ 1st Year
__Position:__ "Deer-In-Training" of the Deer Club

Meme Bashame is a new student at Hino Minami High School and the 4th official member of the Deer Club. Bashame joined the Deer Club because of her newfound idolization of [Noko Shikanoko](https://anilist.co/character/330136/Noko-Shikanoko), who had offered Bashame kindness and deer crackers: saving Bashame from starving on their first day of high school. Bashame hopes of learning to become a full-fledged deer during her stay in the deer club under Nokotan, viewing her as a sensei of sorts and having somewhat of a passive obsession over them.

Bashame can be described as laidback and sluggish, having no problem falling asleep anywhere and everywhere at anytime, usually ending up dozing on the cold concrete floor. Bashame miraculously never gets sick from this. Bashame also is notable for having illeism, a tendency to refer to oneself in third person when speaking, and a fascination with rice, as Bashame often cooks, eats, and grows rice in the Deer Club, more times being seen with rice than not. This could be from Bashame's passion for self-sufficiency, or Bashame may just really love rice. Bashame also tends to eat this rice excessively, many times being seen with a towering amount of rice in a bowl, much to the shock of other characters. Bashame also cannot whistle.

-등장인물-
  이름: Ohma Tokita
  특징: Having grown up in the lawless territory known as The Inside, the young Ohma was found and adopted by Tokita Niko, who taught him his style of martial arts; the Niko Style. Ohma is a man of above-average height and has an extremely athletic build. His most notable trait is his mop of messy, dark hair that has been compared to seaweed. In addition, Ohma possesses a narrow gaze that exudes both confidence and general indifference.

Ohma is a rough, yet well-meaning individual. He was initially rather arrogant, which often surfaced whenever he fought. During his fights, he was condescending and often belittled and provoked his opponents. A defining trait of Ohma is his lust for battle; ever eager to fight against those who are strong. Despite this love for fighting, he will not fight those that refuse to fight him. Such was the case when Kazuo and his son had done so on separate occasions. That being said, he was also short-tempered and can be quite violent. He was willing to physically assault Hideki Nogi, his employer, when the latter refused to make him Nogi Group's representative fighter, before being stopped by Sen Hatsumi.
  성우: Tatsuhisa Suzuki

  이름: Baki Hanma
  특징: Baki Hanma (範馬 刃牙, Hanma Baki) is the main character and protagonist of the Baki the Grappler franchise. He is the son of Yujiro Hanma and Emi Akezawa. ~!Baki is also the half-brother of Jack Hanma.!~

~!The main character, and son of Yujiro Hanma. He has been training in martial arts since the age of three, and has trained under various teachers and coaches throughout his life. At the age of thirteen, he decided to take his training into his own hands and left the coaches to perform more intense training in his father's footsteps. He later meets with his father and becomes disillusioned as to his father's true character, and afterwards, aims to defeat and kill him. His fighting style is called "Total Fighting" and includes techniques from many different martial arts. He fights Arudi Regan in round 1, Zool in round 2, Igari Kanji in round 3, and Retsu Kaioh in round 4 before facing his brother in round 5 which are the finals of the tournament. He eventually develops the ogre/demon face on his back when fighting his brother, but manages to suppress it. Unlike Yujiro, he chooses to control his killing intent and fight his battles fair and honorably no matter what the outcome.Many of Baki's unusual training methods often earn him the admiration of many of the fighters of the underground arena for example Shadowboxing, or visualizing fighting an opponent, is a big part of Baki's regimen sometimes his visions take an almost corporeal form and given he can easily remember and replicate any technique he sees this gives him a huge edge over his opponents as he can fight them and learn their weakness before actually fighting them. Baki has encounters with all the escaped convicts in the "Search of Our Strongest Hero" series, has just defeated Biscuit Oliva, and is now faced with a new challenge against the prehistoric man Pickle. He is currently waiting for his fight with Pickle after Retsu and Katsumi are defeated. He had a shadow boxing visualization fight with a T-Rex prior to the Katsumi/Pickle fight. He has been recently defeated by Pickle in the Korakuen area.!~

~!During Chapter 312 of Hanma Baki, Baki makes Yujiro forfeit his title of the "Strongest Creature Alive" after making him concede in their fight!~
  성우: Nobunaga Shimazaki

  이름: Saw Paing Yoroizuka
  특징: Saw Paing is a Burmese fighter with a lean and tall physique. He arguably appears much younger than he is, with a youthful and hairless face and spiky, voluminous brown hair and hazel eyes. True to his personality, he often sports a determined and enthusiastic expression with wide eyes and a perpetual grin.

Saw Paing is the polar opposite of his self-proclaimed rival, <a href="https://anilist.co/character/143861/Gaolang-Wongsawat">Gaolan Wongsawat</a> while the latter is calm and apathetic, Saw Paing is hot-blooded, brash, and easily excitable. He is a frequent shouter and yells loud enough to drown out the announcer on the mic in a crowded stadium. His adoptive father, Sanemitsu, casually states that Saw Paing is not a very intelligent person, though he does have (a certain degree of) common sense. Despite his hot-blooded nature, Saw Paing is surprisingly understanding, such as delaying fights with Gaolan if the latter has an appointment.

His rivalry with Gaolan is seemingly one-sided; after Kaolan beat him in a cross-border match at age 16, he frequently sneaks across the border to challenge him to a rematch, even climbing up Kaolan's high-rise apartment to do so, much to the latter's annoyance.

-등장인물-
  이름: Doremi Harukaze
  특징: Self-proclaimed as the "unluckiest pretty girl in the world", Doremi inherits the traits of every main character: clumsy and ditzy, but with a compassion for others. Doremi is the girl who first becomes a witch, and at first, her magic only got her into trouble. One important fact about Doremi is that she has an obsession with steak. However, her hopes of getting one are extremely slim. In each season, she has an open chance to get a steak, but she'd turn it down in some way. Frankly, Doremi's first magic spell was attempting to conjure up one, but it failed.  Doremi has no real love interest, except she has affection for Kotake Tetsuya and Akatsuki of the FLAT4.  Her family consists of her parents, Keisuke and Haruka, and her younger sister, Poppu.
  성우: 

  이름: Hana Makihatayama
  특징: She first appears in Sharp as a baby born from a rose in the Majokai. Doremi and her friends are then assigned to raise her for a whole year. 
Hana-chan always speaks in third person and refers to her mothers without any honorifics. Later in the series Jou-sama gives Hana-chan a magic tap of her own so she is also a witch but of pure blood.
  성우: 

  이름: Momoko Asuka
  특징: Momoko, or Momo-chan, is actually from America. She appears quite late in the series, at the start of the third season, Motto. Momoko is sent by Jou-sama to help Doremi and her friends to bake sweets. She is always loud and hyper, and sometimes blunt. She is closest friends with Doremi.  When she was eight, she became a witch under the apprenticeship of Majomonroe. When Majomonroe fell sick and passed away, Momoko used the forbidden magic to attempt to revive her. Even though it didn't work, she lost her witch powers. Now she is given a second chance.  One important fact about Momoko is that in Motto, she only knew how to speak English. (Only when she was a witch could she speak Japanese.) By Dokkan, her friends had thought her to speak the language, but Momoko would sometimes comment with English words. (Like, "Wow!")  Momoko has no real love interest.  Momoko's birthday is May 6, her favorite color is yellow, and her instrument is the guitar. Her family consists of her parents.
  성우: 

  이름: Onpu Segawa
  특징: Onpu appears in the second half of the first season. She is a child idol, being a singer, an actress, and having her own morning radio show. Hence, she has a large male fanbase who will chase her anywhere. She is also a witch, but was once under the apprenticeship of Majorika's rival, Majoruka.   One important fact about Onpu is that at first she comes off as a selfish and spoiled brat. She then reformed her ways and joined Doremi and co.  Onpu has no real love interest, but she shows affection for Tooru of the FLAT4.  Onpu's birthday is March 3, her favorite color is purple, and her instrument is the flute. Her family consists of her parents.
  성우: 

  이름: Aiko Senoo
  특징: Aiko, or Ai-chan, first appears as a transfer student from Osaka, which shows from her Osaka accent. Like a typical Osakan, Aiko is also very humorous and often cracks jokes. She's the smart aleck type of the group.   One important fact about Aiko is that she has a passion for sports, and is very athletic. She seems to fare better than her classmates and thus makes her popular in the sports department. The only sport she is weak at is swimming.  Aiko has no real love interest, but she shows affection for Leon of the FLAT4.   Aiko's birthday is November 14, her favorite color is blue, and her instrument is the harmonica. Her family consists of her divorced parents, Koji and Atsuko, and Aiko wishes one day for them to be together again.

He is a student of the Asahiyama High School. He lives with his father, Isanari Uesugi, and younger sister, Raiha Uesugi, in a small apartment. He is a serious and hardworking high school student and a prodigy at the top of his grade. Because of his family's perpetual poverty, he takes up the offer to tutor the Nakano quintuplets.

Fuutarou is noted to have a big ego and high confidence. He is straightforward, tactless, and rude; but is actually capable of holding back his emotions.

Despite his tactlessness and crudeness, he is knowledgeable enough in knowing what to say in specific situations when thrown at him; rarely giving up when trying to achieve a specific objective.

Despite his egotistical nature, Fuutarou is very hardworking and has a very high amount of patience; especially when getting the attention of the quintuplets and tutoring them despite various amounts of failures and setbacks. He later on shows a sense of duty strong enough to help the quintuplets in their studies despite them not paying him immediately, even though the money that came with tutoring was the initial reason he accepted the job. He also begins valuing their relationship to the point where he would do things outside of their tutor-student relationship which would later on bloom into a bond where they mutually support each other with little question.

-등장인물-
  이름: Mirai Kasuga
  특징: **Hometown:** Tokyo
**Height:** 156 cm

Full of energy, and a tad bit dense, Mirai is the center of MILLIONSTARS, taking a similar role to Haruka in the original iDOLM@STER series.

She's not a smart girl, as she tends to forget to do her homework, she didn't know who Oda Nobunaga (one of the most, if not the most famous warlord in wartime Japan) was, and she always speaks before thinking. She also seems to be a terrible cook since her homemade special drink caused the Producer to make a really scary face.

Her path to become an idol started when her friend took her to a live idol concert (in the manga, it is Shizuka who she met and the concert in question was 765PRO’s theater show, which Shizuka is also part of) and she became so impressed that she instantly quit her club to become an idol. She is also a rather innocent girl who is embarrassed to be in a swimsuit, and isn't sure whether her feelings for the Producer are love or just respect.
  성우: 

  이름: Shizuka Mogami
  특징: **Hometown:** Saitama Prefecture
**Height:** 162 cm

At first glance, one might think that she's a stoic loner because of her harsh words towards the Producer (“I don't have the time!”, ”A producer like this is better than none I guess”). Although, in truth, she is still childish, somewhat hot-blooded, and really cares for her friends.

The reason she acts harsh towards the Producer is because her distrust of adults (she sees them as selfish and she thinks that they always look down on children). This may have been caused by her overly strict father, who attempted to dictate his only daughter's life, until they got into a fight for said reason (as hinted in the game and in the theater section of THE IDOLM@STER MILLION RADIO!). The official manga confirms that he only let her become an idol after she begged him to let her, but only after giving her an ultimatum: she has one year to become a successful idol, otherwise he'll bar her from idol activities. That's part of the reason that she's so no-nonsense about being an idol. However, if you can prove that you're trustworthy, she'll start to open up to you (in a "tsun" manner).
  성우: 

  이름: Elena Shimabara
  특징: __Hometown:__ Brazil
__Height:__ 160 cm

Elena is a half Japanese-Brazilian girl who lived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil before moving to Japan at the age of 6. This has not only allowed her to speak a little bit of Brazilian-Portuguese, but also to speak a bit of Japanese, too. Although she lived in Brazil for only 6 years, Elena has a great love for football and carnivals. She also wants to perform samba, regardless of place and time.

Elena is very energetic and friendly, but she's not good with formalities. She's also kindhearted and cares for her friends, especially Kotoha and Megumi.
  성우: 

  이름: Hinata Kinoshita
  특징: **Hometown:** Hokkaido
**Height:** 146 cm

From a family of farmers who left her hometown in Hokkaido for Tokyo after being scouted as an Idol, Hinata is a kind, honest, and quite mature girl with an innocent heart, who speaks in a heavy northern dialect. Always places her trust in others even if they're lying, and doesn’t mind if she's lost, as long as she can do her best and have fun with everyone.

She tends to doubt herself and gets nervous before lives, but always does her best so that she can make her family proud. Hinata knows that she's considerably average but is determined not to run away and wants to work as hard as she can. She's fond of cute things, such as stuffed bears and cats, and likes to collect them. She gets worried she'll be judged for liking things that are "too young" for her, but is reassured that it's cute to be interested in them.

She is very close with her family and misses them a lot while she's in Tokyo doing idol work. However, Hinata has grown to love all of the members of the theater and thinks of them as another big family.
  성우: 

  이름: Reika Kitakami
  특징: **Hometown:** Nagano
**Height:** 164 cm

Her personality can only described as free-spirited and childish. She often comes up with weird ideas like giving the Producer a dried fish flavoured chocolate on Valentine's Day, because it's also Dried Fish Day in Japan. She praises the Producer in ways that are hard to take as compliments. For example, she called the Producer a normal person who looks a bit unreliable, but she truly meant it as compliment, since it makes her feel more comfortable around him.

She often takes actions that surprise others, such as choosing a plastic trumpet as a Christmas gift for her parents, mistaking a deer for a bird, or using a dishwashing gel to clean the bathroom. Nevertheless, she always means well. In short, she's a kind-hearted person who loves to see people smile, but possesses a unique way of viewing the world that can be hard for others to understand.

제목 (Romaji): Kinokoinu
제목 (English): Kinokoinu Mushroom Pup
제목 (원문): きのこいぬ
줄거리: Picture book author Hotaru Yuuyami lost his beloved dog, Hanako. He was in the depths of a dark and deep sadness, regretting his inability to do anything about it. One day, he notices a pink mushroom growing under the snow willow tree in his garden. As he gazed at it idly, it suddenly began to move, wagging its tail and coming closer to him. “A mushroom...dog?”

Despite his doubts, he decides to live with this mysterious creature, “Kinokoinu" (Mushroom Dog). Then he started drawing where he wasn't supposed to draw, ate all the melon bread and takoyaki, and made all sorts of messes, but his playful attitude is hard to hate.

The days spent with Kinokoinu, involving his childhood friend Komako-chan, the editor, and Yara-kun of the Mushroom Research Institute, gradually changes Hotaru's expression. This is a slightly mysterious and heartwarming animation that depicts the funny days of Hotaru and everyone together with Kinokoinu, who is too mysterious in many ways.

-등장인물-
  이름: Gintoki Sakata
  특징: __Height:__ 177 cm  

A samurai living in an era where a samurai is no longer needed. To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade. Gintoki lives with Kagura and Shinpachi, taking on odd jobs to make the world a better place...and to pay their rent. In the Joi war, he was known as the "White Devil" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white coat he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear into Amanto. Gintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her. Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response back and merely puts up with them as annoyances.  Gin has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet foods such as parfait, ice cream, and cake. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published in). His favorite type of milk is strawberry milk. Gin will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him easily dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a "Bankai" similar to the hero characters of Bleach. Despite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old Bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he barely got acquainted too, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.   Despite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joi war.

~!During the Shogun Assassination Arc, Gintoki's past is fully revealed, Alongside Takasugi and Katsura, he was taught at Shoka Sonjuku by Yoshida Shoyou. However Shoyou gets captured by the Tenshouin Naraku for abandoning them when he was still known as Utsuro and much later down the line in the Joui War Gintoki is captured along with Katsura and Takasugi, He has a choice to kill his teacher or his two friends. If he kills his teacher, they will be released; if he kills his friends, his teacher will be released; if he does nothing, everyone dies. Faced with an impossible decision, and not wanting to lose anyone he makes the impossible decision and takes Yoshida Shoyou's head.!~
  성우: 

  이름: Kintoki Sakata
  특징: He is a machine made by Gengai, originally meant to be Gintoki's perfect substitute while he was away.   ~! He actually brainwashes the entire town apart from Tama and Sadaharu, replacing their memories of Gintoki with those of himself. Even as to put himself into every Manga Volume and DVD of the series. !~
  성우: 

  이름: Kagura
  특징: __Height:__ 155 cm

Although she appears to be a normal, cute, human girl in Chinese-style clothing, she actually belongs to the Yato Clan, one of the strongest and most bloodthirsty of the Amanto races. The Yato is said to have "transparent" skin that is highly sensitive to sunlight, so Kagura carries a purple parasol at all times. The parasol is also the Yato clan's weapon of choice; Kagura's is bulletproof and fires bullets from its tip. Because of her Yato blood, she is super-strong and can stop a speeding motor-scooter with one hand. Although stronger than most humans, she cannot control her strength perfectly. Her super-human strength makes her extremely bad with pets. Most of her pets, with the exception of Sadaharu, have met with an untimely demise at her hands.  She is also extremely flexible and fast; capable of catching multiple speeding bullets between her teeth and fingers. During a battle, she's often seen flipping through the air and performing various acrobatic feats. Due to her Yato blood, she is capable of rapid regeneration. During the Benizakura arc, she is seen healing from a gunshot wound almost overnight.  Kagura also has an unusually strong appetite. She is able to consume large quantities of food within a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, her tastes are endearingly plain. Sukonbu, rice, and eggs are among her favorite foods.  Her immediate family consists of her father, Umibouzu, a widely recognized alien hunter, her mother, who is deceased, and her older brother Kamui, once presumed missing who is now involved with the space pirates Harusame.  She came to Earth to earn money for her family. She found work fighting for a gang, but when they ordered her to kill her target, she ran away. Not long afterward, she met Gintoki and Shinpachi when Gintoki accidentally ran her down with his scooter. After they helped her to make a clean break from the gang, she intimidated Gintoki into hiring her. She now lives at the Yorozuya and sleeps in Gintoki's closet, like Doraemon.  Kagura and Gintoki share an odd father-daughter-like relationship. Together with Shinpachi, the three of them make for a strange, dysfunctional, yet tightly knit family. Kagura is very protective of Gintoki. Although, she herself has gotten into many fights with him, rarely does she let anyone else pick on him. She seems to trust wholeheartedly in Gintoki's ability and strength. Even in sticky situations, she has no doubt that Gin-chan would come to save her. She has a tendency to imitate Gintoki's bad habits, and would often quote the bad advice he gives her. Some of her lines start with "Gin-chan says..." or "Gin-chan told me..."  Kagura is also somewhat of a tomboy. She is often seen partaking in games with various neighborhood boys. Although her candid manner of speech often causes them to shun her, she doesn't seem to mind. In fact, she has no problem at all with forcing her way into their game. In battle, she has proven to be bull-headed and a sore loser. Like Gintoki, and probably because of his influence, she is not above resorting to petty tricks and manipulation to get the better of her adversary. Unlike many conventional manga heroines, she doesn't display the same consciousness toward decorum, table manners, ​and physical appearance. Puking, cussing, picking her nose, spitting, fighting, and scratching herself is common behavior for Kagura.  She regards Okita, captain of the Shinsengumi, as a rival. She detests him, and appeared to be disgusted when she previously mentioned (about Okita), that "he definitely likes me", but as that hasn't been brought up since, it is uncertain if it should be considered canon, that he apparently likes her.  According to the OVA, Kagura is the first and only Weekly Shonen Jump girl to vomit on-screen. To date, she has induced herself to vomit on several occasions. She also has an uncanny knack for seeming calm or detached during high-tension situations; in episode 5, she slept through a car-chase. Her appetite knows no bounds, and she is especially fond of sukonbu.  In Japanese, Kagura speaks in a stereotypical dialect that is associated with Chinese immigrants. In the English-translated manga, she punctuates her sentences with yup, uh-huh, nope, and the like.   ~!In the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, Kagura meets her older brother, Kamui who abandoned her because she was weak in his eyes.!~ In the last Gintama character popularity poll, she came in 6th place.
  성우: 

  이름: Shinpachi Shimura
  특징: __Height:__ 166 cm

Shinpachi Shimura works under Gintoki to learn the ways of the samurai. He used to stay at his family's dōjo. However, it seems more like he's just trying to help Gintoki pay the rent than to learn. Shinpachi is the captain of the "Otsu's Imperial Guard," a pop singer's fan club.  Shinpachi meets Gintoki after Shinpachi was tripped by the ambassador of Planet Chatoran. Gintoki beats up the ambassador and his guards, not to stand up for Shinpachi, but to get revenge for his spilled parfait. Gintoki frames Shinpachi for the crime, which somehow led to him saving Shimura Tae (Otae), Shinpachi's sister, from becoming part of a brothel.  Despite his meek appearance, Shinpachi is a more than competent swordsman of his family's Kakidō-Ryu, the type of swordsmanship his dojo teaches.  In the character popularity poll, he was in 8th place.  His name is roughly based on Shinsengumi member Nagakura Shinpachi and comedian Ken Shimura.

-등장인물-
  이름: Ranma Saotome
  특징: Training with Genma at Jusenkyou in China, Ranma was thrown into a spring called Nyanniichuan. He emerged as a young girl, according with the spring's curse. When splashed with hot water, he changes back to a boy, but when splashed with cold to room temperature water, he turns into a girl again. As for our well-built 16-year-old hero/heroine, the martial arts is his life. He also possesses a rather large and easily wounded ego, believing his physical strength to be his only virtue. Whenever his pride is damaged, Ranma feels the need to rectify the situation, even when it's not necessarily in his best interest to do so.
  성우: Kappei Yamaguchi, Megumi Hayashibara

  이름: Akane Tendou
  특징: **Occupation**: Material arts student, sports
**Weapon**: Large, wooden mallet.

Akane Tendo is the youngest of [Soun Tendo](https://anilist.co/character/9215/Soun-Tendo)'s three daughters and one of the heirs to the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts.

While Akane is generally shown as compassionate and helpful towards anyone in trouble, she's also a vulnerable, stubborn, relentless, and very short-tempered girl. She frequently becomes angry and jealous, and is apt to hit Ranma, often a reaction to Ranma's own bad traits like his smart mouth and insensitivity, but also due to rampant paranoia and willingness to generally believe the worst of the situations she finds him in. Despite her temper, Akane has a more prominent gentle side. She has come to the aid of her rivals, even consistently feeling compassion towards or helping people who try to make her life miserable. Most of her flaws can be attributed to insecurities about her own attractiveness, skill, or lack of traditionally feminine talents.

  성우: Noriko Hidaka

  이름: Nabiki Tendou
  특징: The second daughter of Soun Tendo. The most important thing to her is money and she'd do anything to achieve it, including blackmailing her own family members. In some stories, she plays an important role in trying to extort money or placing bets just for her own amusement.  She has a sarcastic, materialistic, egoistic, manipulative, sadistic and completely amoral attitude that is a sharp contrast to her older sister.  She can in fact, be seen as the most intelligent character in both manga and anime.
  성우: Minami Takayama

  이름: Kasumi Tendou
  특징: Eldest of the Tendo girls and is the most gentle of the lot. She has graduated high school and spends most of her day looking after the Tendo household, acting as the family&#039;s substitute &quot;matriarch&quot; ever since her mother&#039;s untimely death; by cooking, cleaning and helping her family.  Kasumi is portrayed as the perfect lady, with a very sweet, caring and self-sacrificing personality. Probably because of her extremely lovely nature, she is seldom affected by most of the crazy happenings around her and is wise in seeing through Nabiki&#039;s schemes.
  성우: Kikuko Inoue

  이름: Soun Tendou
  특징: Soun is the head of the Tendo household and one of the two families to practice Anything Goes Martial Arts. He&#039;s a widower, left to single-handedly take care of his three daughters. He has a large house that is occasionally in need of repairs due to the fights that take place there. While he owns his own dojo, students have not been explicitly shown. Community representatives frequently approach him when they have problems with unusual phenomena, so this may provide some of it, and he has rented out the dojo for social meetings. However he is shown to be quite careful with the expenses and gets upset when Nabiki spends his savings on expensive gifts, or when Ranma throws the dinner on the floor. In the anime, he spends most of his time playing Shogi with his old training partner Genma. Soun is eager for his daughter to say she loves Ranma, or the other way around, to continue the legacy of his school. He&#039;ll start announcing wedding plans if Ranma and Akane seem romantically involved. Soun is able to manifest himself as a ghostly, floating oni head, whenever he is upset, and often cries &quot;Oh, the humanity!&quot; in the anime. He generally assumes most incidents are Ranma&#039;s fault. He&#039;s shown as extremely protective of his children, and becomes sad if their affection is in doubt.  Miss Hinako is attracted to him, but he is very loyal to his dead wife and visits her grave in memorial.  (Wikipedia)

However, while she is calm and mature, she often flies into a panic when under pressure, jumping to conclusions and making mistakes. Because of this, and a previous incident on which she failed to play the piano at a live audience, she does not think she is special, so she does not want to become a school idol. However, her friend Chika drags her into it, in the hopes this would inspire her to keep playing the piano.

Before joining Aqours, she is an avid reader at the school's library. She and Yoshiko were friends during kindergarten, and Yoshiko calls her "Zuramaru".

줄거리: Hikari Kuroda, a classmate who often comes over to read manga to my house, the house of an inconspicuous "otaku" in class. The reason why Kuroda, who I thought I would never have anything to do with, started hanging out at an otaku's house three months ago was because she asked me if I had all the volumes of a very popular manga, and when I answered that I did... "I'm bored today, so I'll go read it." I don't find it annoying at all that she's started hanging out at my house. Because... She lets me use her pussy instead.

-등장인물-
  이름: Leonardo da Vinci
  특징: Leonardo is an individual from the 15th-16th century, revered as one of the greatest geniuses of human history. 

Often called The Almighty for his vast knowledge and deep mastery of every craft, from Arts to Science. Despite not being from a long-running lineage of Magi, and not having any Magic Crests, DaVinci still excelled at Magecraft thanks to diligent study. 

DaVinci is the Third successful Summoning performed at Chaldea. Summoned when the system was still incomplete, she had limited time at her disposal, but curious about Chaldea's circumstances, and convinced by Romani, she decided to stick around. To do so she created a duplicate puppet to act as her Master through a masqueraded contract. This is also the reason why she can't fight, she needs a real Master to actually become a full-fledged Heroic Spirit. 

Though normally male, when summoned he takes the appearance of Mona Lisa. He pursued ideal beauty in life so he is content in becoming the embodiment of ideal beauty in death.
  성우: Maaya Sakamoto

  이름: Ritsuka Fujimaru
  특징: Ritsuka Fujimaru is the protagonist of Fate/Grand Order, acting as the Master of many Servants for the purpose of solving the Grand Order conflicts. He has absolutely no background details or connections to other people or events. He is simply "someone who just happened to see a recruitment flyer at a station, applied and got accepted into the job, and somehow ended up getting taken into the Chaldea Security Organization.'' 

He is a rather mediocre magus with skills comparable to Lord El-Melloi II.
 
~!After the events of First Order, Ritsuka is the only magus available to tackle the Singularities thus becoming the epitome of the everyday man tasked with saving the world!~
  성우: Nobunaga Shimazaki

  이름: Goredolf  Musik
  특징: Goredolf Musik is the new owner and director of Chaldea Security Organization. After the events of Epic of Remnant, he purchased the organization before it could be divided up by the Mage's Association.
  성우: Atsushi Imaruoka

  이름: Saber
  특징: They’re the Saber-class Servant summoned by Miyamoto Iori in Fate/Samurai Remnant.
A Servant of the Saber class who is dressed in an old-fashioned style and wields a wavy sword. Saber suddenly appeared in front of Iori and saved him from a crisis. Claiming that Iori is weak, this proud Heroic Spirit intends to fight the Waxing Moon Ritual alone. Saber seems to be interested in the peaceful streets of Edo.
  성우: 

  이름: Ozymandias
  특징: Rider's True Name is Ozymandias, a person from the 13th~14th Century BC. The third Pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt who governed over a vast empire, also bearing the title of The greatest hero of ancient Egypt.

He believes that his invocation was given by the need to save the world from its current state, to sort the current holder of a broken humanity, and that those who oppose him should be burned by his power.

A wise ruler and exemplary statesman who, while fighting the Hittites, eventually made peace and brought about a thriving prosperity to ancient Egypt by means of "cultural exchange and interaction". Ozymandias shows a personality of a person with a big ego, seeing himself as a god, but does not go as far as disrespecting the gods of his time. Unlike other demigods or beings with Divinity, Ozymandias is one that is not contrary to the law of the heavens. Unlike Gilgamesh, he freely declares his True Name, Ozymandias, believing that the world should kneel by the return of his radiant presence.

Eventually, she was turned into a vampire by Deathtopia Virtuoso Suicide-Master to save her from the curse of beauty.!~

줄거리: Compilation film of the three Kizumonogatari movies.

Spring break, an interval of time between the second and third year of high school. It was one fateful evening when Koyomi Araragi encounters her.

Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade.
Legendary Vampire. Killer of Apparitions. King of Apparitions.

Her legs and arms were cruelly torn apart, her extravagant dress soaked in red; she's a monster who finds herself in a tragic state, laying in a pool of her own blood. However, Koyomi finds her to be beautiful this way. 

On the brink of death after losing her four limbs, she asks Koyomi to save her. After experiencing fear, chaos, and finally conflict, Koyomi gives his own blood in order to save her.
But when he awakens, he finds himself re-born as her vampire kin.

Koyomi wishes to revert to being a human from a vampire. However, he must take back all of Kiss-shot's limbs to do so. Working as a negotiator, Meme Oshino stands in middle ground as Koyomi attempts to recapture her four limbs by challenging three powerful vampire hunters.

This hellish spring break, the final one of his high school life, is only just beginning.

-등장인물-
  이름: Shinobu Oshino
  특징: A girl who lives with [Oshino Meme](https://anilist.co/character/22552/Meme-Oshino) in an abandoned building. She loves donuts from the Mister Donut chain. At the beginning of Hitagi Crab, she was renamed "Shinobu" by Meme, who suggested that the name Shinobu (忍), comprised of a heart (心) under a blade (刃), matched her original persona.

~!She appears to be an eight year old girl, but was originally a beautiful vampire who had lived for more than 500 years. After the events of Koyomi Vamp, she was left in a weakened condition with no powers or traces of her original personality, and therefore had to abandon her "Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade" name. Prior to being a vampire, she was a princess of unparalleled beauty. She was referred to as "Princess Beauty" or "Acerola" during this time, the latter being her original name. Eventually, she was turned into a vampire by Deathtopia Virtuoso Suicide-Master to save her from the curse of beauty.!~
  성우: Maaya Sakamoto

  이름: Koyomi Araragi
  특징: __Height:__ 165 cm   

A third year high school student who is close to failing every class except math.

Due to events prior to Kizumonogatari and Bakemonogatari, Koyomi avoided having friends and seemed to have lost faith and trust in people and himself.

~!During spring break, he gave [Kiss-Shot](https://anilist.co/character/23602/Shinobu-Oshino) his blood and became a vampire. Although [Meme Oshino](https://anilist.co/character/22552/Meme-Oshino) helped him become human again, there are a few lingering side effects; he can see in the dark and far distances, and he heals faster than the average human. He is still scared of morning sunlight even though it no longer has any effect on him.!~
  성우: Hiroshi Kamiya

  이름: Meme Oshino
  특징: Meme is a middle-aged man who lives in an abandoned building. Being an expert in apparitions field, he solves [Koyomi](https://anilist.co/character/22036/Koyomi-Araragi) and others' problems. Although he sometimes expects compensation, he does not require it always and seems to help those in need from good nature. Due to his vast knowledge of supernatural studies and general oddities, he serves as Araragi's informant during his stay in the city. Meme is a graduate of Shinto studies in college, although he never pursued the career of being a Shinto priest. Despite that, he is perfectly capable to accomplish spiritual works of a Shinto priest, such as exorcising entities and solving paranormal mysteries. He occasionally wears a Priest's outfit, as seen with the session with [Senjougahara](https://anilist.co/character/22037/Hitagi-Senjougahara) and the heavy crab. Meme's other notable accessories include an earring on his right ear and a necklace, both consisting of an inverted cross.

Masaki Fujiwara has a problem. Recently, he's been aware that he's been feeling lust towards his mother. He understands that it's not normal. But he can't suppress his overflowing emotions. Unable to even talk to his close childhood friend about it, he becomes frustrated... and his reason reaches its limits. He keeps staring at his mother's beautiful back. Her voluptuous body arouses his sexual desire. Even her gentle motherly voice draws Masaki's heart... and finally, he touches her. But his mother's reaction is something Masaki never expected. "What a child... lusting after your own mother...!" His mother's angry voice and hands torment Masaki's actions, yet for some reason a strange sense of elation wells up inside Masaki's heart. And the same thing was happening to his mother, Mitsue's heart. A masochistic mother (no blood relation) and a childhood friend with a queenly temperament. Which will your true nature choose?

-등장인물-
  이름: Luffy Monkey
  특징: __Height:__ 172 cm
__Affiliations:__ ~!Straw Hat Pirates (Captain); Four Emperors!~ 
__Devil Fruit:__ Gomu Gomu no Mi (Rubber-Rubber Fruit) 
__Devil Fruit Type:__ Paramecia
~!__True Devil Fruit:__ Hito Hito no Mi Model: Nika (Human-Human Fruit)
__True Devil Fruit Type:__ Mythical Zoan!~
__Bounty:__ ~!3,000,000,000 (previously: 1,500,000,000, 500,000,000, 400,000,000, 300,000,000, 100,000,000 and 30,000,000)!~

Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends with all of them and values them over all else. At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  

Luffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial "D".  

Although Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  

Luffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Author Eiichiro Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  

Luffy has a dream, and to even have a chance at achieving this dream, he says that he must find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.

Sanji is the chain-smoking chef of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew. He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef "Red Leg" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his "love-cook" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a "strict upbringing".

His goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.  Being the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well.
  성우: Hiroaki Hirata

  이름: Zoro Roronoa
  특징: __Height:__ 178 cm (5'10") , 181 cm (5'11")
__Affiliation:__ ~!Straw Hat Pirates (current); Kuraigane Island (former, temporary); Shimotsuki Village (former)!~
__Position:__ First Mate
__Bounty:__  ~!1,111,000,000 (previously: 60,000,000, 120,000,000 and 320,000,000)!~

Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by [Luffy](https://anilist.co/character/40/Luffy-Monkey). 

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand, and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his normally, tied on the arm bandana, on his head. Though not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. 

Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, however he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like [Nami](https://anilist.co/character/723/Nami), he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.  

Zoro often reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.

  이름: Nami
  특징: __Height:__ 169 cm (5'6½”), 170 cm (5'7")
__Affiliation:__ Straw Hat Pirates
__Position:__  Navigator
__Bounty:__  ~!366,000,000 (previously; 16,000,000 and 66,000,000)!~

Nami is the third person to align herself with Straw Hat Pirates, and the fifth to actually join as an offical member. Possibly one of the best navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions.
  성우: Akemi Okamura

  이름: Usopp
  특징: __Height:__ 174 cm (5'8½"), 176 cm (5'9¼") 
__Affiliation:__ Straw Hat Pirates (previously Usopp Pirates)  
__Position:__ Sniper  
__Bounty:__  ~!500,000,000 (previously 30,000,000 as Sogeking, 200,000,000 as God Usopp)!~  
 
Usopp is a liar and likes to play pranks on his crew members or just goof off with [Luffy](https://anilist.co/character/40/Luffy-Monkey) and [Chopper](https://anilist.co/character/309). He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle, he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in [Zoro](https://anilist.co/character/62/Zoro-Roronoa) who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon "Clima Tact." 

Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Usopp also has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father [Yasopp](https://anilist.co/character/9562/Yasopp) of the Red Haired Pirate Crew.
